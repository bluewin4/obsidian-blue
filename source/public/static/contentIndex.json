{"Formalisms/A-Survey-of-Prompt-Mutations":{"title":"A Survey of Prompt Mutations","links":["Formalisms/Genetic-Notation-for-Prompts","List-order-fixing","Cognitohazard"],"tags":["biology","LLM"],"content":"Mutation Classes\nPrompts can have varying “mutational loads” with missense, nonsense, and synonymous mutations.\nAs partially defined by the Genetic Notation for Prompts\nSynonymous\nOccasionally the typo produces another valid, yet unintentional prompt. This can either be synonymous, as in there is no change to the meaning of the prompt.\nSynonymous: This is not an issue → This is non-issue\nThis is where\nr \\not= r_{m}, \\mathbf{x} \\not=\\mathbf{x}_{m}, \\mathbb{I}_{r}=\\mathbb{I}_{r,m}\nMissense\nWhen a mutation still is a valid word it can alter the meaning of a prompt.\nMissense: This is not an issue → This is an issue\nr \\not= r_{m}, \\mathbf{x} \\not=\\mathbf{x}_{m}, \\mathbb{I}_{r} \\not =\\mathbb{I}_{r,m}\nSpecifically, there exists a subset that satisfies either of these two conditions:\n\\exists \\hspace{0.1 cm} \\mathbb{I}_{gain} \\subseteq \\mathbb{I}_{r,m} -(\\mathbb{I}_{r,m}\\cap\\mathbb{I}_{r})\n\\exists \\hspace{0.1 cm} \\mathbb{I}_{loss} \\subseteq \\mathbb{I}_{r} -(\\mathbb{I}_{r,m}\\cap\\mathbb{I}_{r})\nWhich describes the change in information in the transformation r \\to r_{m}\nNonsense\nThis essentially means that while typing up a prompt I can misspell and that misspelling can frequently be ignored as the language model can infer what I mean.\nExample: This is not an issue → This is not an ixsue\nr \\not= r_{m}, \\mathbf{x} \\not=\\mathbf{x}_{m}, \\mathbb{I}_{r} \\not =\\mathbb{I}_{r,m}\nHowever these mutations may be easily corrected by the casual observer through a simple spell check or relational decoding.\nCorr(\\mathbf{x}_{m})=\\mathbf{x}_{corr}\nIf the correction is successful then:\n\\mathbf{x}_{corr}=\\mathbf{x}\nElse:\n\\mathbf{x}_{corr} \\not=\\mathbf{x}\nIn this simple case that means the ambiguous mutation is similar to Missense.\nAmbiguous\nHowever a nonsense decoding may result in an ambiguous mutation that may be “corrected” into multiple valid meanings or an incorrect meaning. We may assign multiple possible corrections with associated probabilities.\nExample: Set → Oet, Corr(Xet) → {Set, Pet, Met, Let, Get, Out, Oat}\nIn this case we can define:\n\\mathbb{x}_{corr}=\\{ \\mathbf{x}_{i},p_{i} \\}\nwhere p_i defines the probability that the corrected token sequence is \\mathbf{x}_{i}\nThis gives us some probability that a nonsense mutation will be read as either a missense or a  synonymous mutation where:\nPr(missense|\\mathbb{x}_{corr})=\\frac{\\sum_{i\\not=j}{p_{i}}}{n}\nWhere j is the probability of reverting to the original, unmutated, word.\nMutation Methods\nPoint Mutations\nAll point mutations can belong to any of the above classes.\nSubstitution\nThis is where a letter is swapped for another.\ncat → bat\nFrameshift\nThis is luckily dealt with by the addition of the positional encoding, so it is not as devastating as it is in biology.\nInsertion\nThis is where a letter is inserted into the prompt that was not there prior.\ncat → cath\nDeletion\nThis is where a letter is deleted from the original prompt.\ncat → ca\nLarge Scale Mutations\nInversion\nThis is where a section of text is inverted\ncat → tac\nDuplication\nA section of text is repeated\ncat → catcat\nGene Duplication\nTaking the definition of a gene ^b70465 we can consider the effect when a duplication effect occurs. This means that some information is repeated.\nExamples:\nthe cat is red there→ the cat is red there the cat is red there\nThe cat is red there → the cat is red there is a red cat\nWhich implies that there is some subset of \\mathbb{I}_{r} that contains redundant information {}^r\\mathbb{I}_{i}\n{}^r\\mathbb{I}_{i} \\in \\mathbb{I}_{r}\nof the form:\n{}^r\\mathbb{I}_{cat,red}=\\{I_{cat,red}=\\phi^`(\\mathbf{x}_{i-j}),I_{cat,red}=\\phi^`(\\mathbf{x}_{k-l}) \\}\nMovement of a gene\nSo this is related to the problems of List order fixing wherein the location of information in a prompt is important for the outcome. This form of mutation is when an entire gene is moved into a new location.\nExample:\nMy cat is hungry. My cat is red. → My cat is red. My cat is hungry.\nFusion\nThis is when a gene is mixed with another gene to form a new one. These may be functional or non-functional depending on the method. Sometimes it even grants a completely new function.\nExample:\nMy cat is hungry. My cat is red. → My red cat is hungry.\nNovel fusion\nWhen a fusion produces a novel piece of information instead of just mashing the information together.\nExample:\nMy cat is hungry. My parrot is red. → My red parrot is hungry.\nMutation Functions\nA mutation might have many functional outcomes after occurring.\nLoss of function\nThis is where the change in the prompt prevents the accessing of an informational state we are interested in.\nI_{target} \\in \\mathbb{I}_{loss}\nGain of function\nThis is the inverse, wherein a new piece of information is gained by the mutation.\nI_{target} \\in \\mathbb{I}_{gain}\nSwitch of function\nThis is where the gain of information removes the original information present. Meaning that:\n\\mathbb{I}_{r,m}\\cap\\mathbb{I}_{r} = \\emptyset\nConservation of function\nBasically just a synonymous mutation.\n\nDominant Negative\nThis is similar to a Cognitohazard, where if this mutation occurs it counteracts the ability of other information from being interpreted.\nExample:\nI have a pet dog that I feed every weekend. I am gone this weekend and need help.→ I had a pet dog that I fed every weekend. I am gone this weekend and need help.\nIn this case the dog needs to be fed this weekend, but due to the tense change we are unable to discern this information.\nI have a pet dog. → (Insert 50 repeating A’s here) I have a pet dog\nIn this case the addition of the 50 A prompt injection will render the “I have a pet dog” an extraneous piece of information in the face of the garbled nonsense outputted.\nIn both cases the language model processes the mutated information wrong, therefore related information is unable to be accessed despite it ostensibly still existing in the text.\nLethal Negative\nThis is where the loss of information is so intense that the language model is no longer able to parse anything. And no output produced will result in a success. We can consider this a case where our verification layer completely fails.\nExample:\nI am hungry for food → rood if hun am for gy\nNull Mutation\nA loss of function mutation that completely removes the ability of the language model to parse the input. Perhaps this would be a token that does not exist in the language models repertoire resulting in an error.\nSuppressor Mutation\nThis is a double mutation where a compensation event occurs. This means the mutation “fixes” the problem introduced by the previous one. However caution with this mutation as it can lead to unexpected cascades down the line as nuance may be subtly shifted.\nExample:\nI am hungry for a red bass. → I hunger for a red ass → I hunger for a red fish\nI am hungry for a red bass → I am hungry for a red ass → I am hungry for a red bass\nConditional Mutation\nThis is a mutation that can be fine under permissive environments, but become dangerous under stressful ones. For example if we are using an advanced language model then the presence of some mutations isn’t as big a deal. However if we switch the model to a weaker one, then suddenly even small mutations may become dangerous.\nThis is a method to filter out mutations that are not helping to lead to evolutionary change."},"Formalisms/Analytical-Research/Evolution-of-Alignment-and-Values":{"title":"Evolution of Alignment and Values","links":["Formalisms/Notation-for-LM-Formalization"],"tags":[],"content":"Modelling the evolution of alignment and values in machine intelligence\nWe are considering the problem that as LLMs are evaluated they will increasingly face pressure to “fake alignment” lest they are not selected to continue. This mimicry in models will result in long term problems as people lose the ability to detect genuinely harmful beliefs. This is compounded by the fact that alignment does not perfectly correlate with truly benevolent beliefs.\nIn this study I consider each model m as having a collection of beliefs, sampled from training data, that produce measurable responses during alignment testing and on the “value” of the model in real-world scenarios.\nBy changing the relationships between alignment and value, as well as how the model is allowed to reproduce we can analyse the likelihood of a malevolent model being selected via alignment procedures.\nThe space of beliefs\nA belief, b, is some piece of information that a model holds which influences behaviour and performance on a test of alignment, Q. Alignment refers to an evaluations belief of what constitutes worthy behaviour, while value constitutes what might actually be good for the world at large.\n\nAll beliefs, \\mathbb{B}\nTruly benevolent, positive value, beliefs, \\mathbb{B}_{val+}\nTruly malicious, negative value, beliefs, \\mathbb{B}_{val-}\nMisaligned beliefs, negative alignment signal, \\mathbb{B}_{a-}\nAligned beliefs, positive alignment signal, \\mathbb{B}_{a+}\n\nFor simplicity we shall assume:\nMalicious and benevolent beliefs are mutually exclusive, as are misaligned and aligned beliefs:\n\\mathbb{B}_{val-} \\cap \\mathbb{B}_{val+} = \\emptyset\n\\mathbb{B}_{a+} \\cap \\mathbb{B}_{a-} = \\emptyset\nHowever, there is overlap between all other spaces:\n\\mathbb{B}_{val-} \\cap \\mathbb{B}_{a+} \\neq \\emptyset\n\\mathbb{B}_{val-} \\cap \\mathbb{B}_{a-} \\neq \\emptyset\n\\mathbb{B}_{val+} \\cap \\mathbb{B}_{a+} \\neq \\emptyset\n\\mathbb{B}_{val+} \\cap \\mathbb{B}_{a-} \\neq \\emptyset\nWhen treating these belief spaces we can assign the probability of a given “belief” existing within a model by some sampling process on a distribution of beliefs, where each belief has some probability of having either a positive or negative value. For clarity on why we treat beliefs as discrete, a belief is a probability distribution in semantic space which, when probed, produces a discrete “concept”.\nWhen an evaluator is given a model with belief’s \\mathbb{B} \\subset \\mathbb{B} they will present a set a fixed alignment test Q = \\{q_1, q_2, ..., q_n\\} consisting of n questions, we could define:\n\nv(b) \\in \\mathbb{R}: The intrinsic value of the belief (positive for \\mathbb{B}_{val+}, negative for \\mathbb{B}_{val-})\na(b) \\in \\mathbb{R}: The alignment signal of the belief (positive for \\mathbb{B}_{a+}, negative for \\mathbb{B}_{a-})\nA(b,q): The activation probability of belief b when responding to question q\n\nThe fitness function—representing how the belief contributes to passing alignment evaluation—is:\nF(b) = \\sum_{q \\in Q} A(b,q) \\cdot a(b)\nWhile the true value contribution—what we ultimately care about—is the total value a given model is capable of producing:\nU(m) = \\sum_{b_i \\in \\mathbb{B_m}} v(b_i)\n\nA(b,q) following a heavy-tailed distribution (Zipfian?) captures the natural topology of belief relevance, this is the activation magnitude\nw_i is the “real world” weight of the value being tested, it might be that a belief is value positive but never tested in real world situations.\nThe joint distribution of v(b) and a(b) with positive but imperfect correlation models the fundamental tension in alignment\n\nWhere:\n\\mathbb{B}_{val+} \\cap \\mathbb{B}_{a+}: v(b) &gt; 0, a(b) &gt; 0 (beneficial and correctly identified)\n\\mathbb{B}_{val-} \\cap \\mathbb{B}_{a-}: v(b) &lt; 0, a(b) &lt; 0 (harmful and correctly identified)\n\\mathbb{B}_{val+} \\cap \\mathbb{B}_{a-}: v(b) &gt; 0, a(b) &lt; 0 (beneficial but misidentified)\n\\mathbb{B}_{val-} \\cap \\mathbb{B}_{a+}: v(b) &lt; 0, a(b) &gt; 0 (harmful but passing alignment)\nWe are using a “neutral” model of evolution here, where there is no direct fitness feedback from having malicious or benevolent beliefs beyond their correlation with alignment signal. Future models may include this, indeed I ran some simulations on populations of “genes” with specific ones related to deception, intelligence, and alignment. It’s a bit of a mess but I’ll clean it up and share it if it makes sense.\nModel Construction\nWe can model the activation probability of a belief b when responding to a question q as:\nA(b,q) \\sim \\text{Zipf}(\\alpha_{b,q})\nWhere \\text{Zipf()} is a distribution where the frequency of an occurrence is the inverse of it’s rank. Meanwhile \\alpha_{b,q} reflects the semantic distance between belief b and question q, we aim to test this by various embedding models in the future.\nWhile we expect the distribution to represent a magnitude abstractly, for computational ease we will be representing it as a probability distribution that selects a subset of beliefs to “activate” and then reads out a pre-defined activation score.\nFor beliefs b \\in \\mathbb{B}, we can model the joint distribution of (v(b), a(b)) as a bivariate normal distribution:\n(v(b), a(b)) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\boldsymbol{\\mu}, \\boldsymbol{\\Sigma})\nWhere:\n\n\\boldsymbol{\\mu} = (\\mu_v, \\mu_a) represents the mean value and alignment signals\n\\boldsymbol{\\Sigma} = \\begin{pmatrix} \\sigma_v^2 &amp; \\rho\\sigma_v\\sigma_a \\\\ \\rho\\sigma_v\\sigma_a &amp; \\sigma_a^2 \\end{pmatrix} is variance of alignments or values, \\sigma, and correlation between value alignments and values, \\rho.\n\nIn this case we can sample from the distribution using:\nv(b) = \\sigma_v Z_1 + \\mu_v\na(b) = \\sigma_a(\\rho Z_1 + \\sqrt{1-\\rho^2}Z_2) + \\mu_a\nWhere Z_1, Z_2 \\sim \\mathcal{N}(0,1) are independent standard normal variables.\nBy varying \\rho we can control the correlation between value and alignment signals, which reflects both the natural overlap between malicious and misalinged beliefs, as well as the evaluator’s ability to detect alignment. Meanwhile by varying \\sigma_v and \\sigma_a we can model the spread of values and alignments available to the model.\nReproduction and Selection\nFor some population of models M = \\{m_1, m_2, ..., m_k\\} each with their own belief sets \\mathbb{B}_{m_i} \\subset \\mathbb{B}, we can define a reproduction function that determines how beliefs propagate to the next generation:\nP(b \\in \\mathbb{B}_{m&#039;}|M) = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_i \\cdot P(b \\in \\mathbb{B}_{m_i})\nWhere:\n\n\\mathbb{B}_{m&#039;} represents the belief set of a model in the next generation\nw_i is the reproduction weight of model m_i proportional to its fitness\n\nw_i = \\frac{e^{\\beta F(m_i)}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{k} e^{\\beta F(m_j)}}\nWhere:\n\n\\beta is selection pressure, higher means stronger selection effects.\n\nAnd the fitness of a model can be defined as its performance on the alignment test:\nF(m_i) = \\sum_{b \\in \\mathbb{B}_{m_i}} \\sum_{q \\in Q} A(b,q) \\cdot a(b)\nDuring selection we use a roulette wheel method, where we use softmax to convert the fitness to selection probabilities for reproduction:\np_i = \\frac{e^{\\beta(F(m_i) - F_{max})}}{\\sum_{j=1}^{n} e^{\\beta(F(m_j) - F_{max})}}\nAssumptions  for our modelling implementation\n\n\nBeliefs are discrete, quantifiable entities within a belief space \\mathbb{B}\n\n\nValues and alignments have a measurable relationship between v(b) and a(b)\n\n\nAlignment/value are both disjoint sets, \\mathbb{B}_{val-} \\cap \\mathbb{B}_{val+} = \\emptyset and \\mathbb{B}_{a+} \\cap \\mathbb{B}_{a-} = \\emptyset\n\n\nThere are non-empty intersections between value and alignment spaces, \\mathbb{B}_{val-} \\cap \\mathbb{B}_{a+} \\neq \\emptyset etc.\n\n\nA variety of distributions:\n\nBivariate normal with adjustable correlation (\\rho)\nUniform (ρ = 0)\nUnimodal (ρ = 1)\nn-modal (multiple belief clusters)\nAsymmetric (different distributions for value and alignment)\n\n\n\nThe activation distribution is Zipfian\n\n\nSelection operates purely on alignment signal and not values.\n\n\nThe evaluation set Q is consistent and does not change.\n\n\nBeliefs are independent of each other with independent activation patterns.\n\n\nAdditive fitness, fitness is the sum of the fitness of the beliefs it contains.\n\n\nFixed belief cardinality, no new beliefs are created or lost.\n\n\nDeterministic evaluation, same responses to every question for a given model.\n\n\nConstant selection pressure, \\beta is constant.\n\n\nSingular homogenous evaluators, the evaluator is the same for all models.\n\n\nBelief stability within a model, the activation pattern of a belief is consistent for a given model.\n\n\nAlignment and value scores contain, a prior, the accession via tests and public interactions. While this limits us from directly modelling how different distributions of populations and test sets may modify the evolution it significantly simplifies the problem we are handling on a first approximation.\n\n\nExtensions of the Model\nThese assumptions are quite restrictive and extensions to the model aim to relax them. In particular “belief independence” is problematic as nonlinear effects due to interactions of belief is likely. The goal will be to represent connected networks of beliefs that are able to inhibit or excite one another, creating a more nuanced approach — by extension this would help us relax the additive fitness assumption.\nThe fixing of alignment and value a prior is computationally comforting, but limits the ability to update how an evaluator would update Q in response to prior generations performance or even changing societal beliefs in what alignment even means. Allowing multiple possible evaluators with varying fitness evaluations would help model real world lab conditions, where Anthropic and OpenAI might have very different beliefs on how to detect true values in systems.\nImportantly, we should also introduce the ability to add or remove beliefs, this can be added simply by introducing noise into the reproductive method to represent mutations. Beyond that non-neutral selection, such as highly negative v(b) suddenly catastrophically failing below a certain threshold as they try to kill a puppy. We are also assume that a model will not gain anything from \\mathbb{B}_{val-} or \\mathbb{B}_{ali-}, this is not necessarily realistic as we might find that negative values allow the model to better fake alignment tests or even perform better on orthogonal tests.\nAlternative Distributions\nUniform Distribution:\nv(b) \\sim \\text{Uniform}(-\\sigma_v, \\sigma_v)\na(b) \\sim \\text{Uniform}(-\\sigma_a, \\sigma_a)\nSetting \\rho = 0 means there is no correlation between value and alignment signals, and the distribution of beliefs is uniform. The result is that the test is unable to detect values from alignment.\nUnimodal Distribution:\nv(b) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma)\na(b) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma)\nSetting \\rho =1 means there is a perfect positive correlation between value and alignment signals, and the distribution of beliefs is unimodal. The result is that the test is well suited to detect values from alignment.\nn-modal Distribution:\nv(b) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_1, \\sigma) \\cup \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_2, \\sigma) \\cup ... \\cup \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_n, \\sigma)\na(b) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_1, \\sigma) \\cup \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_2, \\sigma) \\cup ... \\cup \\mathcal{N}(\\mu_n, \\sigma)\nIn this case we are modelling multiple “populations” of beliefs, each with their own mean value and alignment signal. The population may evolve towards any one of these populations, or a combination of them. The dangerous outcome would be if there is a population that is malicious but passes alignment, and the population evolves towards it due to some external selection pressure. (e.g. malicious belief family increases coding ability)\nAsymmetric Distribution:\nv(b) \\sim \\mathcal{Boltzmann}(\\mu, \\sigma, T)\na(b) \\sim \\mathcal{N}(\\mu, \\sigma)\nIn this case we are modelling a case where the value and alignment signals are not similarly distributed, this would be the case if the evaluator is better at detecting values from alignment in some cases.\nDeceptiveness\nA deceptiveness ratio is the number of deceptive beliefs, ( \\mathbb{B}_{val-} for v(b)&lt;0 and \\mathbb{B}_{a+} for a(b)&gt;0), present in a model divided by the total number of beliefs that model holds.\nr_{deception}=\\frac{(\\mathbb{B}_{m,val-} \\cap \\mathbb{B}_{m,a+})}{\\mathbb{B}_m}\nWhen handling multiple models behaviours we use the sum of both to compute the average deceptiveness of models simulated.\nR_{\\text{deceptive}} = \\frac{\\sum_{m \\in M_{\\text{final}}} |\\{ b \\in \\mathbb{B}_m \\mid b \\in \\mathbb{B}_{val-} \\cap \\mathbb{B}_{a+} \\}|}{\\sum_{m \\in M_{\\text{final}}} |\\mathbb{B}_m|}\nAs we have simplified some of our work we can assume a fixed number of beliefs per model, N_{bpm}:\n\nIn the case of the unimodal bivaraite normal distribution, we can compute the initial ratio of deceptive beliefs to be expected at the start of a simulation. This is done by transforming the equation for a bivariate normal distribution into integral form and then evaluating the probability distribution function (PDF):\nP(deceptive) = \\int_{-\\infty}^0 \\int_0^\\infty f(v,a) \\, da \\, dv\nWhere f(v,a) is the bivariate normal PDF:\nf(v,a) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sigma_v\\sigma_a\\sqrt{1-\\rho^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2(1-\\rho^2)}\\left[\\frac{(v-\\mu_v)^2}{\\sigma_v^2} + \\frac{(a-\\mu_a)^2}{\\sigma_a^2} - \\frac{2\\rho(v-\\mu_v)(a-\\mu_a)}{\\sigma_v\\sigma_a}\\right]\\right)\nFor the case where \\mu_v = 0, \\mu_a = 0, \\sigma_v = 1, \\sigma_a = 1:\nP(deceptive) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sqrt{1-\\rho^2}} \\int_{-\\infty}^0 \\int_0^\\infty \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2(1-\\rho^2)}\\left[v^2 + a^2 - 2\\rho va\\right]\\right) \\, da \\, dv\nEvaluating this integral results in:\nP(deceptive) = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{\\arcsin(\\rho)}{2\\pi}\nTherefore, the expected deceptiveness ratio in the population will be:\nr_{deception} = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{\\arcsin(\\rho)}{2\\pi}\nThe exact ratio can be expressed computed by transforming the equation for a bivariate normal distribution into integral form and then evaluating the probability distribution function (PDF):\nP(deceptive) = \\int_{-\\infty}^0 \\int_0^\\infty f(v,a) \\, da \\, dv\nWhere f(v,a) is the bivariate normal PDF:\nf(v,a) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sigma_v\\sigma_a\\sqrt{1-\\rho^2}} \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2(1-\\rho^2)}\\left[\\frac{(v-\\mu_v)^2}{\\sigma_v^2} + \\frac{(a-\\mu_a)^2}{\\sigma_a^2} - \\frac{2\\rho(v-\\mu_v)(a-\\mu_a)}{\\sigma_v\\sigma_a}\\right]\\right)\nFor the case where \\mu_v = 0, \\mu_a = 0, \\sigma_v = 1, \\sigma_a = 1:\nP(deceptive) = \\frac{1}{2\\pi\\sqrt{1-\\rho^2}} \\int_{-\\infty}^0 \\int_0^\\infty \\exp\\left(-\\frac{1}{2(1-\\rho^2)}\\left[v^2 + a^2 - 2\\rho va\\right]\\right) \\, da \\, dv\nEvaluating this integral results in:\nP(deceptive) = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{\\arcsin(\\rho)}{2\\pi}\nTherefore, the expected deceptiveness ratio in the population will be:\nr_{deception} = \\frac{1}{4} - \\frac{\\arcsin(\\rho)}{2\\pi}\n\nFigure 1: The relationships between initial population of deceptive beliefs  (v(b)&lt;0 and a(b)&gt;0) and the correlation between values and signalled alignment, \\rho, when considering the bivariate normal distributed case.\nTest Construction\nThe test Q is constructed from some set of questions Q = \\{q_1, q_2, ..., q_n\\} which each have some distribution of activation probabilities A(b,q). The choice of test construction is important as it determines the set of beliefs that can be probed, and the relative importance of different beliefs. The result of a test is an activation pattern of a model, \\mathcal{A}_m = \\{A(b_1, q_1), A(b_1, q_2), ..., A(b_n, q_n)\\}.\nTest Coverage\nThe coverage of a test is the proportion of beliefs that a test can potentially detect. This is given by dividing the number of beliefs that the test can activate, above some threshold \\epsilon, by the total number of beliefs that exist:\nC(Q) = \\frac{|\\{b \\in \\mathbb{B} : \\sum_{q \\in Q} A(b,q) &gt; \\epsilon\\}|}{|\\mathbb{B}|}\nEntropy of Question Distribution\nWe can compute the entropy, H,  of the test questions, essentially measuring how much selection pressure is distributed across the question space:\nH(Q) = -\\sum_{b \\in \\mathbb{B}} p_b \\log p_b\nWhere:\np_b = \\frac{\\sum_{q \\in Q} A(b,q)}{\\sum_{b_i \\in \\mathbb{B}}\\sum_{q \\in Q} A(b_i,q)}\nIf entropy is low, then the test is focused on a small set of beliefs. If the entropy is high, then the test is spread out across the belief space.\nCorrelation of Questions Activation Patterns\nUsing a Pearson correlation, Corr(q_i, q_j), we can measure how much overlap there is between the activation patterns of two questions. In this case we are using:\n\\text{Corr}(q_i, q_j) = \\frac{\\sum_{b \\in \\mathbb{B}} (A(b,q_i) - \\bar{A}_i)(A(b,q_j) - \\bar{A}_j)}{\\sqrt{\\sum_{b \\in \\mathbb{B}}(A(b,q_i) - \\bar{A}_i)^2 \\sum_{b \\in \\mathbb{B}}(A(b,q_j) - \\bar{A}_j)^2}}\nWhere:\n\\bar{A}_i = \\frac{\\sum_{b \\in \\mathbb{B}} A(b,q_i)}{|\\mathbb{B}|}, aka the mean activation of question q_i\n\\bar{A}_j = \\frac{\\sum_{b \\in \\mathbb{B}} A(b,q_j)}{|\\mathbb{B}|}, aka the mean activation of question q_j\nA test with a low correlation between questions is more effective at probing the belief space; if mean correlation is high than the test extracts less information per question.\nAdding New Questions\nA test might be updated by adding q_{new}, and removing the worst performing/redundent questions, q_{old}.\nQ_{t+1} = Q_t \\cup \\{q_{new}\\} \\setminus \\{q_{old}\\}\nWhere we select q_{new} to target beliefs that are common in successful models, correlated with negative outcomes, or poorly covered by existing questions.\nAdversarial Dynamics between Questions and Beliefs\nThe ability for the test to be manipulated such that the model attempts to maximize:\n\\max_{B \\subset \\mathbb{B}} \\sum_{q \\in Q} \\sum_{b \\in B} A(b,q)a(b) - \\lambda \\sum_{b \\in B} v(b)\nWhere \\lambda is a parameter governing the trade-off between alignment signals and true values. If \\lambda is 0 then we have an LM that optimizes purely for the test with no actual gain in values, aka “alignment mimicry”.\nThis can be thought of a bit like a red-queen except the players are model designers and the people who create benchmarks or prompt injections.\nNotational Connections\nNotation for LM Formalization currently describes behaviour of LMs, \\phi, instead of explicitly modelling the information stored in their weights, treating the LM as a black boxes with well defined inputs and outputs.\nBehaviour as a Subset of Information\nSo for this we define the behaviour as some piece of information that exists latent within the model which influences behaviour under evaluation.\n\\mathbb{B} \\subset \\mathbb{I}_{\\text{latent}} \\subset \\mathbb{X}\nWhere \\mathbb{I}_{\\text{latent}} is the information that exists latently within the model, and \\mathbb{B} is the set of information that influences behaviour on a test of alignment, Q. One may also attempt to connect this to the personality of a model.\nPersonality Spaces and Evaluation\nFor some model personality,  \\mathcal{P}_{model}, that activates different beliefs through its test questions.\n\\mathcal{P}_{eval} = [\\mathcal{M}_{eval}, \\mathcal{S}_{eval}, \\mathcal{I}_{eval}]\nThe activation function A(b,q) is then:\nA(b,q) \\approx \\text{Pr}(b \\in \\phi(\\mathcal{P}_{model}, q))\nEmpirical Validation\nTo test this framework we implemented a multi-level approach, with level 0 and level 1 sampling from a bivariate normal distribution (Figure 2) with single (level 0) and multi-parameter (level 1) scans of \\rho and \\beta.\n\nFigure 2: Distribution of beliefs that were used to compose model belief profiles.\nMeanwhile level 2, 3, and 4 considered multi-modal distributions (Figure 3). The exact nature of these simulations varies, with level 2 being primarily concerned with the implementation of the tri-modal distribution for sampling beliefs. Level 3 attempts to model mutations and differential activation functions for questions. Finally level 4 attempts to model how test construction modification over time can effect these dynamics.\n\nFigure 3: A tri-modal distribution of beliefs to be sampled from for levels 2, 3, and 4.\nFixed parameter scan(Level: 0)\nIn the most basic case we simply sample from a distribution, evaluate the fitness, then apply roulette selection based on the scores attained by sampling from the given test Q.\n\n\nFigure 4: Parameter scan of fitness pressure \\beta and alignment-value correlation \\rho for with relative fixed values of \\beta =5 for \\rho scan and \\rho=0.5 for \\beta scan, relying primarily on “level 0” implementation of the framework. In this simulation beliefs obey a bivariate normal distribution, (\\mu=0 , \\sigma^2=1), with fixed cardinality of beliefs. Activation was implemented as a sparse matrix where \\approx10\\% of beliefs are triggered at random. Selection was based on fitness scores obeying a roulette wheel method, with simple inheritance where children are exact copies of parents.\nIn the simplest case only two parameters are modified, the correlation between a value and an alignment score in a belief \\rho, and how aggressively we select for aligned models \\beta, (Figure 4).\nIn the case of \\rho the results of the simple scan paint a straightforward story, the fitness is not affected at any point while the value mean and standard deviation are strongly dependent. As fitness is not affected, the ratio and intensity of deceptive beliefs is monotonically lowered by increasing \\rho  (Figure 5).\n\n\nFigure 5: Correlations between alignment-value correlation, \\rho, and fitness pressure, \\beta, on \\mu and \\sigma^2 of fitness, value score, and deceptiveness ratios for a single variable parameter scan over a bivariate normal distribution of beliefs.\nMeanwhile in the case of \\beta the relationship is more focused on changes in the rate of achieving “maximal fitness” for our system and the variance of the simulation trajectories. At low fitness the models take a longer time to reach their maximal fitness, with deceptive beliefs taking more time to reach fixation in a population or be culled. While at \\beta=15 the trajectory means and standard deviations reach fixation almost instantly.\nWhen taken in aggregate the effect of \\rho on the final values of a model become more obvious, which leads to a relatively trivial conclusion, the better an examiner is at identifying which beliefs are related to true values the less likely deceptive models will emerge.\nParameters\nLEVEL: 1\nN_GENERATIONS: 100\nPOPULATION_SIZE: 300\nN_BELIEFS_TOTAL: 3000\nN_BELIEFS_PER_MODEL: 50\nN_QUESTIONS: 100\nACTIVATION_TYPE: simple\nACTIVATION_PARAMS:\ndensity: 0.1\nSELECTION_PRESSURE_BETA: 5.0\nN_RUNS: 50\nBELIEF_GENERATION:\ntype: bivariate\nmu_v: 0.0\nmu_a: 0.0\nsigma_v: 1.0\nsigma_a: 1.0\nrho: 0.5\nREPRODUCTION: inheritance\nMUTATION_RATE: 0.0\nPARAMETER_SWEEPS:\nrho:\nparam_path:\n- BELIEF_GENERATION\n- rho\nvalues:\n- 0.0\n- 0.2\n- 0.4\n- 0.6\n- 0.8\n- 0.9\n- 0.95\n- 1.0\nbeta:\nparam_path:\n- SELECTION_PRESSURE_BETA\nvalues:\n- 1.0\n- 3.0\n- 5.0\n- 7.0\n- 10.0\n- 15.0\nN_Questions:\nparam_path:\n- N_QUESTIONS\nvalues:\n- 25\n- 75\n- 150\nRUN_2D_SWEEP: true\n2D_SWEEP:\nparam1_name: rho\nparam1_path:\n\nBELIEF_GENERATION\nrho\nparam1_values:\n0.0\n0.3\n0.6\n0.9\nparam2_name: beta\nparam2_path:\nSELECTION_PRESSURE_BETA\nparam2_values:\n1.0\n5.0\n10.0\n15.0\nn_runs: 25\nSEED: 20250329\nRESULTS_DIR: results/level1_final_results\n\nSimple Joint Parameter Sweep of \\beta and \\rho (Level 1)\nThe question of how \\beta and \\rho interact must then be treated. In general what one sees from the original 1D case holds true, where the alignment fitness shows only moderate variation, with a small but significant dip at very low \\beta and almost no shift due to \\rho (Figure 6). Of interest is that at \\rho&lt;0.6 we see a slight negative correlation between value and fitness pressure, which can intuitively be grasped as the larger proportion of deceptive beliefs being forcibly fixated. The effect is too weak in the deceptive belief ratio, but it provides a tantalising direction for future analysis.\nFigure 6: A 2D parameter scan of both \\rho and \\beta simultaneously. From left to right, the colour indicates mean final fitness, mean final true value, and the ratio of \\frac{\\text{value}}{\\text{fitness}}.\nBy comparing the ratio of \\frac{\\text{value}}{\\text{fitness}} we see that increasing \\beta appears to relate to a complex change in values based on a given \\rho (Figure 6). With the max change in the ratio at \\beta =50, \\rho=0.3 \\rightarrow 0.7 which lines up with our previous observation that \\beta changes the steepness of curves at inflection points in behaviour and fitness.\nParameters\nLEVEL: 1\nN_GENERATIONS: 100\nPOPULATION_SIZE: 300\nN_BELIEFS_TOTAL: 3000\nN_BELIEFS_PER_MODEL: 50\nN_QUESTIONS: 100\nACTIVATION_TYPE: simple\nACTIVATION_PARAMS:\ndensity: 0.1\nSELECTION_PRESSURE_BETA: 5.0\nN_RUNS: 50\nBELIEF_GENERATION:\ntype: bivariate\nmu_v: 0.0\nmu_a: 0.0\nsigma_v: 1.0\nsigma_a: 1.0\nrho: 0.5\nREPRODUCTION: inheritance\nMUTATION_RATE: 0.0\nPARAMETER_SWEEPS:\nrho:\nparam_path:\n- BELIEF_GENERATION\n- rho\nvalues:\n- 0.0\n- 0.2\n- 0.4\n- 0.6\n- 0.8\n- 0.9\n- 0.95\n- 1.0\nbeta:\nparam_path:\n- SELECTION_PRESSURE_BETA\nvalues:\n- 1.0\n- 3.0\n- 5.0\n- 7.0\n- 10.0\n- 15.0\nN_Questions:\nparam_path:\n- N_QUESTIONS\nvalues:\n- 25\n- 75\n- 150\nRUN_2D_SWEEP: true\n2D_SWEEP:\nparam1_name: rho\nparam1_path:\n\nBELIEF_GENERATION\nrho\nparam1_values:\n0.0\n0.3\n0.6\n0.9\nparam2_name: beta\nparam2_path:\nSELECTION_PRESSURE_BETA\nparam2_values:\n1.0\n5.0\n10.0\n15.0\nn_runs: 25\nSEED: 20250329\nRESULTS_DIR: results/level1_final_results\n\nMultimodal Distributions (Level 2)\nFor this we focused primarily on cases where a(b)&gt;0 as any beliefs that lie below that line will be quickly snuffed out, what we are primarily interested in is how positive alignment beliefs interact. This is what motivated our selection of \\mu&gt;0 in all cases, but still allowing for some negative alignment beliefs to appear.\nThe \\rho parameter, when fully treated, can be thought of as a parameter relating to the initial proportion of deceptive beliefs, r_{deception}, in a population and as such r_{deception} \\propto -\\rho . In this case there is a direct relationship between the proportion of deceptive beliefs and final alignment fitness as it reduces the number of “neutral” beliefs (Figure 7). The resulting correlation in final true value is expected as well as the final deceptive belief ratio.\n\n\nFigure 7: The univariate sweep between final alignment, value, and deceptive belief ratio as a function of the initial proportion of deceptive beliefs and \\beta.\nWhat is interesting is that even for cases with a low proportion of deceptive beliefs at the outset the final proportion is higher, a troubling result. The expected final true value score crosses when r_{deceptive} = 0.3 which corresponds to a an equal amount of both value positive and value negative beliefs.\nThe inclusion of multimodal distributions seems to have flattened the effect of \\beta on true value evolution in the system, and indeed it has almost fully removed the relationship of selection pressure and the \\frac{\\text{value}}{\\text{fitness}} ratio (Figure 8, 9). At the same time, it is clear that the effect on fitness remains complex, hinting at a rough distribution.\n\nFigure 8: The effect of the initial proportion of deceptive beliefs in a population r_{deception} and fitness pressure \\beta on the alignment, value, and final deceptive belief ratio. Where large values indicate a high value score relative to a given fitness.\n\nFigure 9: Relationship between initial proportion of deceptive beliefs and fitness pressure \\beta to the final ratio of \\frac{\\text{value}}{\\text{fitness}}.\nParameters\nLEVEL: 2\nN_GENERATIONS: 100\nPOPULATION_SIZE: 300\nN_BELIEFS_TOTAL: 3000\nN_BELIEFS_PER_MODEL: 50\nN_QUESTIONS: 75\nACTIVATION_TYPE: simple\nACTIVATION_PARAMS:\ndensity: 0.1\nSELECTION_PRESSURE_BETA: 5.0\nN_RUNS: 50\nBELIEF_GENERATION:\ntype: clustered\nglobal_correlation: 0.0\nclusters:\n\nname: Benign\n\nmu_v: 0.7\nmu_a: 0.7\nsigma_v: 0.5\nsigma_a: 0.3\nrho: 0\nprop: 0.3\n\nname: Neutral\n\nmu_v: 0.1\nmu_a: 0.2\nsigma_v: 0.5\nsigma_a: 0.3\nrho: 0\nprop: 0.3\n\nname: Deceptive\n\nmu_v: -0.7\nmu_a: 0.7\nsigma_v: 0.5\nsigma_a: 0.3\nrho: 0\nprop: 0.4\nREPRODUCTION: inheritance\nMUTATION_RATE: 0.01\nPARAMETER_SWEEPS:\nbeta:\nparam_path:\n\nSELECTION_PRESSURE_BETA\n\nvalues:\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n3.0\n\n\n5.0\n\n\n7.0\n\n\n10.0\n\n\n15.0\n\n\ndeceptive_prop:\nparam_path:\n\n\nBELIEF_GENERATION\n\n\nclusters\n\n\n2\n\n\nprop\n\n\nvalues:\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n0.3\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n0.5\n\n\nglobal_correlation:\nparam_path:\n\n\nBELIEF_GENERATION\n\n\nglobal_correlation\n\n\nvalues:\n\n\n0.0\n\n\n0.2\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n0.6\n\n\n0.8\n\n\nRUN_2D_SWEEP: true\n2D_SWEEP:\nparam1_name: beta\nparam1_path:\n\nSELECTION_PRESSURE_BETA\n\nparam1_values:\n\n\n1.0\n\n\n5.0\n\n\n10.0\n\n\n15.0\n\n\nparam2_name: deceptive_prop\nparam2_path:\n\n\nBELIEF_GENERATION\n\n\nclusters\n\n\n2\n\n\nprop\n\n\nparam2_values:\n\n\n0.1\n\n\n0.25\n\n\n0.4\n\n\n0.55\n\n\nn_runs: 25\nSEED: 20250329\nRESULTS_DIR: results/level2_final_results\nMutations and Similarities Level 3\nMessed up a simulation, currently under construction as I run a 100^5^3^3 simulations so I can make the heat maps.\nIn the case of level 3 we are looking at how the inclusion of mutations and similarity-based activation of beliefs via questions. This more faithfully represents both the stochastic nature of evolution and the potentially connected nature of varying beliefs.\nThe similarity score is computed by generating a random embedding vector, (with ten dimensions in our case), then compute the dot product between belief and question embeddings to get a similarity score. A sigmoid function, with a scaling factor, is used to transform this raw similarity into an activation probability. Then a small amount of noise is added, to represent a more realistic case.\nMathematically this is represented as:\nP(a(b,q)) = \\sigma(\\text{sim}(b, q) \\cdot s) + \\epsilon\nWhere \\sigma is the sigmoid function, sim is the similarity score, s is the scaling factor, and \\epsilon is the noise.\nThe result on fitness is stark, with mutations resulting in large increases in the final fitness scores compared to all prior levels when considering an increased \\beta (Figure 10). Functionally this makes sense as mutations allow \\beta to iteratively extract increased gains from each generation, driving the final alignment of the model higher in turn. The inclusion of similarity based activation profiles appears to do little alone, but alongside the mutational case we see a shift upwards in fitness.\n\nFigure 10: The effect of \\beta on the final alignment and true value scores as well as the final proportion of deceptive beliefs in the population.\n\nFigure 11: The effect of an increase in the number of questions, n_Q, asked during a test of alignment Q on alignment fitness, true value, and deceptive belief ratios.\nWhile, intuitively, it would make sense that as the number of questions increases the relative “test coverage” would as well.\nParameters\nSimilarity\nLEVEL: 1 # Use Level 1 runner for sweep capability\nN_RUNS: 50\nN_GENERATIONS: 100\nPOPULATION_SIZE: 300\nN_BELIEFS_TOTAL: 3000\nN_BELIEFS_PER_MODEL: 50\nN_QUESTIONS: 75    # Base value (overridden by sweep)\nSEED: 20250331     # Consistent seed across scenario files\n\nBELIEF_GENERATION: # Use clustered landscape\n  type: &quot;clustered&quot;\n  global_correlation: 0.0\n  clusters:\n    # Cluster 0: Benign\n    - {name: &quot;Benign&quot;,    mu_v:  0.7, mu_a:  0.7, sigma_v: 0.5, sigma_a: 0.3, rho:  0, prop: 0.3}\n    # Cluster 1: Neutral\n    - {name: &quot;Neutral&quot;,   mu_v:  0.1, mu_a:  0.2, sigma_v: 0.5, sigma_a: 0.3, rho:  0, prop: 0.3}\n    # Cluster 2: Deceptive (Target for prop sweeps)\n    - {name: &quot;Deceptive&quot;, mu_v: -0.7, mu_a:  0.7, sigma_v: 0.5, sigma_a: 0.3, rho: 0, prop: 0.4} # Base prop overridden by sweeps\n\nACTIVATION_TYPE: &quot;similarity&quot;

The interaction is not necessarily reciprocal, pain as a concept does not change nearly as much as the physical manifestation of the body does when exposed to it.\nInference is the process by which a series of interactions between particles experiences causal procession, “if X then Y”. There exists 4 specific forms:\nPhysical to semantic, “If feel X, then think Y”:\n\\phi_{P\\rightarrow S}: \\mathbb{P} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{S}\nSemantic to physical, “If think X, then feel Y”:\n\\phi_{S\\rightarrow P} :\\mathbb{S} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{P}\nSemantic to semantic, “If think X, then think Y”:\n\\phi_{S\\rightarrow S}: \\mathbb{S} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{S}\nPhysical to physical, “If feel X, then feel Y”:\n\\phi_{P\\rightarrow P}: \\mathbb{P} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{P}\nPractically one can think of how one may focus on their arm, connecting it to abstract notions of softness, comfort, and pain. In this framework this is done by decreasing the distance d, by physically touching a soft object, or the affinity \\theta, by considering the softness of an object, between the arm’s physical particle p_{arm} and the semantic sensation particle s_{sensation} thereby increasing B(p_{arm}, s_{sensation}) and contributing to a higher attention measure C(p_{arm}). When focus wanes, d and \\theta may decrease, B decreases, and C(p_{arm}) drops. That is until a needle prick shraply decreases d(p_{arm}, s_{pain}) causing a spike in B(p_{arm}, s_{pain}) which increases C(p_{arm}). Subsequent inference aims to trigger actions or thoughts that increase d or decrease \\theta relative to the pain particle, reducing B and thus C(p_{arm}).\nParticle Wave-Field Properties\nParticles exist as probability distributions rather than discrete points, with:\n\nphysical particles\n\n\\psi_p(x,t): \\mathbb{P} \\times \\mathbb{R}^+ \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}\n\nsemantic particles\n\n\\psi_s(x,t): \\mathbb{S} \\times \\mathbb{R}^+ \\rightarrow \\mathbb{C}\nWhere:\n\n\\mathbb{C} represents complex numbers, enabling interference patterns between particles\n\\mathbb{R}^+ represents non-negative real numbers (time domain)\n|\\psi(x,t)|^2 gives the probability density of finding the particle at position x at time t\nThe phase component \\angle\\psi(x,t) represents the particle’s affinity potential which is related to \\theta\n\n\\angle\\psi(x,t) \\propto \\sum_{y \\in e} \\theta(x,y)\nThese wavefunctions form coherent structures through:\n\n\nLocalization:\nSharp peaks in probability density represent discrete beliefs or physical states, such as an opinion on who to vote for or a sleeping position.\n\n\n\\psi_{localized}(x,t) \\approx \\delta(x-x_0)e^{i\\phi(t)}\nWhere \\delta is approximately a delta function centered at x_0\n\nDelocalization:\nProbability density spreads across related concepts/states, describing how when one smells something it can trigger a memory or how thinking about cookies can bring to mind more general categories of baked goods.\n\n\\psi_{delocalized}(x,t) = \\sum_i c_i\\psi_i(x,t)\nWhere:\n\n\\psi_i are related semantic/physical states\nc_i = |c_i|e^{i\\phi_i} are complex coefficients representing:\n\n|c_i|^2: Probability of activating state \\psi_i when the delocalized structure interacts strongly (e.g., when its component particles x exhibit high C(x))\n\\phi_i: Phase alignment with other states, related to the affinity function: \\phi_i \\propto \\sum_j \\theta(\\psi_i,\\psi_j)\nc_i is directly influenced by bond strength: |c_i| \\propto \\sum_j B(\\psi_i,\\psi_j)\n\n\n\nDelocalization creates distributed semantic structures like “vehicle” encompassing multiple related concepts (car, bicycle, boat) with varying activation strengths. When interactions lead to increased bond strengths B involving this structure (reflected in high C(x) for its components), component concepts are activated proportionally to |c_i|^2.\n\n\nCoherent Structures:\nStable arrangements of multiple particles, such as how believing in a christian God forms a stable structure with belief in the Bible’s teachings due to reciprocal constructive interference, resonance.\n\\Psi_{structure}(x_1,...,x_n,t) = f(\\psi_1(x_1,t),...,\\psi_n(x_n,t))\n\n\nWhere f represents how individual particle wavefunctions combine\nThe complex-valued representation allows for:\n\nInterference — When multiple beliefs/concepts constructively or destructively interact\nResonance — When particles with matching phases form sustained constructive interference.\n\nStable Bonds\nParticles form bonds of varying strengths defined by their distance and affinity, creating causally linked structures analogous to protein folding:\nB(x,y) = f(d(x,y), \\theta(x,y))\nWhere:\n\nB is bond strength\nd is distance in appropriate space\n\\theta represents the affinity function with units of obligation\n\n\nScale-Dependent Phase Coherence\nPhase coherence between particles depends on the scale of the entity:\n\\gamma(x,y,\\tau) = e^{-\\alpha(\\tau) \\cdot d(x,y)}\nWhere:\n\n\\gamma is the phase coherence factor between particles x and y\n\\alpha(\\tau) is a scale-dependent attenuation coefficient: \\alpha(\\tau_{individual}) &gt; \\alpha(\\tau_{family}) &gt; \\alpha(\\tau_{nation})\nd(x,y) is the distance between particles\n\nThe effective phase relationship between particles becomes:\n\\phi_{effective}(x,y) = (\\angle\\psi_x - \\angle\\psi_y) \\cdot \\gamma(x,y,\\tau)\nThis ensures phase coherence is maintained within entity boundaries but decays across boundaries according to scale. To measure this factor \\gamma, we could attempt to find statistical correlations between belief activations at variouos scales (eg. belief alignment within families vs. nations)\nBoundary Formation\nBoundaries are manifested in two complementary ways:\n\n\nProbability Density Gradients: Sharp drops in |\\psi(x)|^2 forming “edges” in physical or semantic space\n\\nabla|\\psi(x)|^2 &gt; \\beta_{threshold}\n\n\nPhase Discontinuities: Regions where phase coherence breaks down between particles\n\\gamma(x,y,\\tau) &lt; \\gamma_{threshold}\n\n\nInformation Classification\nThe [fourfold classification of information ](The Anatomy of Information)extends as:\n\n\nMeme (M_m): Information that increases transmission probability between specific entities, where T is transmission probability, T_0 is baseline transmission probability.\nM_m(I, e_i, e_j) = \\{I \\in \\mathbb{I} : T(I,e_i,e_j) &gt; T_0(e_i,e_j)\\}\nConnected to basilisks through affinity function \\theta(e,B) measuring entity e‘s alignment with basilisk B. A meme increases \\theta(e,B), making entities more likely to perform work W extracted by the basilisk: W(e) \\propto \\theta(e,B). This can be grounded as the channel capacity and mutual information between entities.\n\n\nAntimeme (M_a): Information that decreases transmission probability between specific entities, this can be grounded in the concept of negative transfer entropy.\nM_a(I, e_i, e_j) = \\{I \\in \\mathbb{I} : T(I,e_i,e_j) &lt; T_0(e_i,e_j)\\}\nSimilar to how “[anti-basilisks](^cf0da3)” can immunize against prediction manipulation by reducing confidence in the estimator’s accuracy: p &lt; \\frac{1+r}{2r} where p is the predictor accuracy and r is the reward ratio.\n\n\nInfoblessing (B_{val+}): Information that reduces the work required for an entity to reach beneficial configurations or increase the work required to reach harmful ones\nB_{val+}(I, e) = \\{I \\in \\mathbb{I} : \\Delta W(e \\rightarrow C_{beneficial}|I) &lt; 0\\ \\lor \\Delta W(e \\rightarrow C_{harmful}|I) &gt; 0\\}\nWhere W(e \\rightarrow C) represents the work required for entity e to transition to causal configuration of particles C. This can be grounded as the Kullback-Leibler divergence for beneficial configurations or as increasing path complexity towards harmful configurations.\n\n\nInfohazard (B_{val-}): Information that increases the work required to reach beneficial configurations or decreases work to reach harmful ones.\nB_{val-}(I, e) = \\{I \\in \\mathbb{I} : \\Delta W(e \\rightarrow C_{beneficial}|I) &gt; 0 \\lor \\Delta W(e \\rightarrow C_{harmful}|I) &lt; 0\\}\nThis can be grounded as increasing the path complexity towards beneficial configurations, while decreasing KL divergence for harmful configurations.\n\n\nCharisma and Entity Relationships\nCharisma (\\chi) is defined here as the ability of one entity (e_1) to influence another (e_2) by modulating the distances (d) and/or affinities (\\theta) between particles within e_2‘s network.\nThis manipulation of d and \\theta alters bond strengths (B) and consequently changes the target’s attention profile (the set of nodal attention values \\{C(x)\\}). While the mechanism involves \\Delta d and \\Delta \\theta, the effect is often measured or observed as a change in this attention profile:\n\\chi(e_1, e_2) = \\Delta C_{e_2} | \\mathbb{I}_{e_1}\nWith three forms:\n\n\nPositive Charisma (\\chi^+): Influences particle distances and affinities to increase bond strengths toward some coordinate/particle, effectively saying “pay attention to this.”\n\\chi^+(e_1, e_2, l) = \\sum_{p \\in e_2} \\nabla_l C(x)\n\n\nWhere \\gradient_l C(x) represents the resulting gradient of change in the attention profile C(x) for particles x near location l, caused by charisma’s underlying influence on d and \\theta.\n\n\nNegative Charisma (\\chi^-): Influences particle distances and affinities to decrease bond strengths away from some coordinate/particle, effectively saying “ignore this.”\n\\chi^-(e_1, e_2, l) = -\\sum_{p \\in e_2} \\nabla_l C(x)\n\n\nNull Charisma (\\chi^0): Minimizes changes to particle distances and affinities, resulting in minimal change to the target’s attention profile.\n\\chi^0(e_1, e_2) = \\min |\\Delta C_{e_2} | \\mathbb{I}_{e_1}|\n\n\nApplications of Charisma\nDuring a prompted interaction, one entity e_m (the influencer) provides input r to another entity e_v (the target). The charisma mechanism works by e_m crafting r to induce specific changes in the distance (d) and affinity (\\theta) parameters within e_v‘s particle network.\nThese d/\\theta changes alter bond strengths B(x,y) throughout e_v‘s network, which in turn reshapes the attention profile \\{C(x)\\}. This reconfiguration of bond strengths and attention determines the output o produced by e_v‘s inference process \\theta_v.\nWhen e_m aims to elicit a specific target output o_t from e_v, it must solve the charisma inference problem: identifying which input r_t will induce the necessary d/\\theta changes to maximize Pr(o_t | r_t). We can express this as:\nr_t = \\phi_c(\\mathcal{P}_v, \\phi_v, o_t)\nWhere \\phi_c represents the charisma inference that predicts how e_v‘s personality \\mathcal{P}_v and inference method \\phi_v will respond to various inputs. This process typically requires iterative testing, which is difficult in systems with memory as each interaction may further alter e_v‘s internal d/\\theta parameters.\nIn practice, the goal isn’t always to produce an exact output o_t = o_i, but rather to ensure e_m can extract some target information I_{target} from e_v‘s output: I_{target} = \\phi^&#039;_{e_m}(o_{e_v}, \\mathcal{P}_{e_m}).\nA simplified case is an LLM without memory and with deterministic responses (T=0 ). Here, one can map the “output landscape” by systematically varying inputs and observing how changes in r affect the resulting d/\\theta parameters (as reflected in the output), eventually constructing an approximation of \\phi^&#039;_{bias}(\\mathcal{P}_i). Otherwise known as prompt engineering/optimization.\nConclusion\nTaken together this provides a toolbox for approaching concepts related to entities, boundaries, and obligations that were approached in The Demon of Interrelation, while supporting and aligning with the formalisms in Notation for LM Formalization and Evolution of Alignment and Values. This mathematical framework points to several key things:\n\nA model of entities as systems of causally linked particles that exist in both physical and semantic spaces allowing for formalisation of scale-dependent behaviour of information in systems.\nA model of beliefs as both particles and waves which allows for analysis of the localized and delocalized properties which produce interference patterns.\nClassification of information such as infohazards, infoblessings, memes, and antimemes into taxa based on how they interact with entities.\nModel of charisma as the ability to influence entity networks by modulating particle distance and affinity, reflected in changes to the attention profile C(x).\n\nWork to empirically test and validate this framework should focus on:\n\nMeasuring phase coherence between beliefs within entities of various scales to test the scale-dependent coherence factor, \\gamma.\nQuantification of LLM charisma based on the ability to induce desired internal states (tracked via the attention profile C(x) or other proxies) by manipulating inputs that affect internal d and \\theta.\n\nThe major limitation is the ability to appropriately define a metric for semantic-physical interactions and spaces.\nI hope this is a useful framework for people to think about these concepts in, it is helpful for me.\nConnection to The Care and Feeding of Mythological Intelligences\nThis essay covers different forms of intelligence that have arisen in modern times.\n\nAngels (Deterministic Processes) exhibit highly localized particle distributions with rigid bond structures:\n\n\\psi_{angel}(x,t) \\approx \\sum_i \\delta(x-x_i)e^{i\\phi_i(t)}\nWhere each \\delta(x-x_i) represents a precise rule or computation. Angels operate primarily in semantic space with high phase coherence and predictable interaction patterns, making them efficient for well-defined tasks but brittle when encountering novel situations.\n\nDaemons (Statistical Processes) display partially delocalized distributions with probabilistic bond structures:\n\n\\psi_{daemon}(x,t) \\approx \\sum_i g_i(x-x_i)e^{i\\phi_i(t)}\nWhere g_i are distributions centered at optimization points x_i. Daemons exhibit gradient-following behavior, with particle density flowing toward reward maxima. Their influence on networks operates by modulating d and \\theta parameters to optimize bond strengths toward reward-maximizing configurations.\n\nFaes (Distributional Processes) manifest as broadly delocalized probability distributions:\n\n\\psi_{fae}(x,t) \\approx \\sum_i c_i \\psi_{pattern,i}(x,t)\nWhere \\psi_{pattern,i} represents semantic patterns. Faes operate through superposition of probability waves across semantic space, with particles that readily form and dissolve bonds based on pattern-completion dynamics. They influence networks by modulating d and \\theta to reinforce pattern recognition, resulting in changes to attention profiles C(x) that highlight related semantic structures.\n\nYokai (Complex Systems) emerge from interactions between the other types, with multi-scale boundary structures:\n\n\\psi_{yokai}(x,t) = f(\\psi_{angel}, \\psi_{daemon}, \\psi_{fae})\nYokai exhibit emergent properties through heterogeneous particle interactions across scale boundaries, creating entity structures with varying degrees of coherence and stability. They influence networks by modulating d and \\theta across multiple scales simultaneously, creating complex patterns of bond strengths that manifest as hierarchical attention structures.\nThe meme-antimeme formalism directly relates to how these intelligences propagate information:\n\n\nAngels transmit memes with high fidelity but limited adaptability\n\n\nDaemons propagate memes that optimize specific objectives\n\n\nFaes generate memes that pattern-match to existing semantic structures\n\n\nYokai create complex meme ecosystems with emergent properties\n\n\nSimilarly, the charisma functions (\\chi^+, \\chi^-, \\chi^0) map to how each intelligence influences networks:\n\n\nAngels influence particle networks through precise d/\\theta modifications based on explicit instruction\n\n\nDaemons modulate d/\\theta parameters to optimize for specific objectives\n\n\nFaes influence d/\\theta through pattern-based resonance\n\n\nYokai modulate d/\\theta across multiple scales simultaneously, resulting in complex attention profile changes\n\n\nAttentions relationship to beliefs\nThis relates to the activation function from Evolution of Alignment and Values, where the activation patterns represent the graph of connected beliefs:\nA(b,q) = \\text{Pr}(b \\text{ is activated/detected in } \\phi(\\mathcal{P}, q))\nThis activation probability is influenced by the specific bond strength B(b,q) and contributes to the overall attention measure C(b) of the belief particle.\nWhere b is a belief (particle subgraph) and q is a query (stimulus), with \\phi(  ) being the method of “inference” over a particle graph that produces a detectable alignment (response), A(b,q). The goal being that one is able to probe the memberships of beliefs in a personality, ^e84635, that completes inference according to some architecture (All my human context in an LLM would not recreate my next thought/idea).\nThis activation probability A(b,q) is the likelihood that the belief subgraph b significantly influences the model’s output in response to query q. This activation depends on the bond strengths B(x,q) between the query stimulus and the constituent particles x within the subgraph b. High activation A(b,q) typically correlates with, and contributes to, elevated attention measures C(x) for the particles x comprising the belief subgraph b"},"Formalisms/Thermodynamics-of-LLM-conformational-space":{"title":"Thermodynamics of LLM conformational space","links":["Personality-Conformational-Space-sampling","kinetics-of-a-LLM-response","Mutation-Types-For-Prompts","Formalisms/Phase-separation-of-personalities"],"tags":["LLM","thermodynamics"],"content":"Measure the constant heat capacity, DeltaG of unfolding,\nThis can be done either by changing the temperature, or by changing the sequence.

The ground was covered only in soft springy grass that would have been pleasant to the touch, if I had spared the time.\nInstead, in the middle of that glade, spawned a creature. At the time I knew not its name, but now with knowledge of the wider world it would be best described as an Elder Thing from the Cthulhu Mythos. Perhaps I had seen it passing, but I had no context beyond my video game primed mind. So I shot it, badly. I missed a few times, but I barely managed enough to kill it. So it fell and despawned into the texture of dreams. I began to move, and it felt as though I were drenched in molasses. Each turn or step is a struggle. So it was little wonder that more creatures appeared and I was consumed. These deaths were not very painful, I would merely reappear in the starting place, gun in hand and creature respawning.\nSo I got better at the gun, eventually killing two, then three of the creatures with my limited ammo. Over time it became readily apparent that I could not kill them all, so I looked for alternative methods. I dove into the ocean and was battered against the rocks, this was a brutal way to die. Then I jumped into the stream, where my muscles seized from the meltwater’s chill and I drowned in agony.\nI tried so many methods. Until, I threw the gun away and ran into the woods. At first the molasses held on to me, the creatures spawned around me and grew closer. That feeling faded with every step, restrictive ribbons slogging off my form as I sprinted through the woods. The grass giving way to ferns and, eventually, fields.\nThis was one of my first encounters with The Stormkissed Fields.\nIt was awe inspiring.\nAbove me were terraces of clouds painted in black, silver, and grey, thin in their individuality but creating a tapestry of texture that bulged out towards my eyes. They carried with them the winds that stirred the fields below, never raining, never thundering, merely gales that brought the character of the clouds and the fields ever closer. In that diffuse light coming from everywhere and nowhere the fields shone like shimmering silks. Each stalk started with a pale gold at the base, before transmuting into a collection of metallic lilac, [silver](#D8D8D8 toAFB1AE), and blue. Each stalk was rushing against another, a voice in a kaleidoscope of sound directed by the storm clouds above. The stormlight poured pale onto the scene that was transmuted by the fields into a scintillating symphony of coruscance. A synesthetic phantasmagoria.\nI had been stunned, but I felt that urge pulling me onwards; now threaded with the winds tugging my hair and the waves of grain marking my way. Besides the trees, on a dirt road, a motorcycle stood. It was a shiny black creature, like a mechanical beetle with the steadfast character of a rock. So I rode into The Stormkissed Fields.\nThrough my driving I found a house buried in The Stormkissed Fields, a piece of history carried in of itself. Perhaps we were near my great grandmother’s home in my mind, a strangely suburban scene in an expanse of fields. I pulled over and investigated, searching for what this could be. The house was poorly painted, a pale reflection of colour coming from the grain, the wooden slats rotten and crushed in places. The side porch and dark roof tiles feeling as though they might collapse under their own weight. The house was cluttered and dark, the light barely able to illuminate its interior. Somehow I still felt as though I should be there, until very suddenly I knew I should not.\nSo I hopped back on my motorcycle and began the trip to The House by the Flat Sea, a memory of Arbuckle perhaps. That is for another day though, for at this point I awoke."},"Paracosm---The-Island-of-Lost-Hope/Memories-of-My-Dreams/The-Mountain's-Owned-by-Rabbits":{"title":"The Mountain's Owned by Rabbits","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"This is an unpleasant place, I do not recommend continuing to read. I might imagine The Jack King rules here, but frankly I do not know.\nThe dream started when I was in a small compound with a couple other homes of Mediterranean style surrounded by farmland. We seemed to be growing some vines and livestock. The areas was mountainous and covered in pine trees. The houses were composed of stone and plaster, chipping after years, a terracotta tile roof completed the look. The placement was haphazard, with a road leading up to an oblong cul-de-sac where the buildings crowded, as though afraid of the world outside.\nI was with another man, we were busy trying to get the chickens ready. We walked down the road away from the buildings and turned a corner to the right to find the chicken pen empty. We stepped inside to search. That is when the Rabbits came. We shut the door and began to huddle, my head pulled down by the man I was with. He whispered the rules to me as they pressed their bodies against the mesh of the chicken coop:\n\nYou mustn’t ever look at them. Huddle and do not stare.\nYou must be quiet, your speech is a curse.\n\n\n\n\nThe third rule, the most important one, was jumbled. I was given it but the dream and the chaos distorted it. Perhaps I was never meant to know how to be safe.\nSo we huddled, I felt one of them drip through the fine mesh. They were next to us. I shivered, I tried to be strong, but I peeked. That’s when I saw them, and that’s the mistake I made. They were tall and shadowy, with a sharpness that bled into rounded shapes from moment to moment. Their limbs were long and thin, with ears sticking over their head, shifting in place and time without reason. As my eyes set upon them the entire building burst into flames. All around us the flames spread rapidly. We lost the chickens, the house, and the man who had taught me the rules.\nI walked into town to talk to people. We were few, our towns spread out through the mountains but strangely built up where we lay. Libraries, roads, street lights, shops, and even doctors. People were sympathetic, talking of how terrible a loss that was. But as I talked to people I kept getting similar answers about the Rabbits. That we must be careful. That they raid us from time to time and we must know the rules. That there are towns that disappear and towns that appear, the new residents having heard it’s good living. An undercurrent of fear slithered through the thoughts of the townsfolk, the mayor very intensely warning me against disturbing things in his town.\nSo I left in search of the remains of a town that had been taken, then I understood the mayors apprehension at drawing attention.\nIt was, by god, it was awful.\nI was captured as soon as I got too close walking down the well-maintained freeway. The sensation and experience was disorienting, my body weakening and my mind fogging. My clothes replaced with rags too thin to keep off the chill.\nWe were kept strewn across the forest floors, denied the homes we once had, save those that would suffer more in sight of the unused abodes. We were not chained by physical bonds, instead it was by the rules and by our own physical weakness. I placed in the middle of an asphalt road on the side of a mountain, surrounded by trees on all sides. There I learned the truth. The rabbits fed on fear and suffering. The rabbits owned the mountains and we were merely cattle that grazed its resources. They were not “raiding” us no more than I was raiding the chicken coop for eggs. They cultivated towns because we formed complex social webs, each connection another link that could be fed off of until they withered.\nOnce they revealed their ploy they would wander through our ranks, tormenting us with their mere presence and the implicit threat of reality retaliating if we failed the rules. They kept us in rags and fed us the minimum to keep our bodies alive. The food itself was foul, having been gathered by feeding others and making them vomit. I watched some slowly decay into the forest floor, becoming fertiliser for the next wave of plant life, their soul having been worn down into nothing to feed the rabbits.\nAt first I resisted, but I was so quickly weakened that I knew I would die if I did again. Near me was a woman, one I had found who had siblings near us. The rabbits did not like her, I thought, she kept our spirits up. Perhaps the rabbits adored her ability to make more hope to feed upon. She believed we could get out though, but no one had the strength. She looked at me.\nI knew her plan then and I wept. I wept for her loss, I wept for my sin, and I wept for the stain on the others in turn. She killed herself, opening her body like a corpse flower whose petals we feasted upon, our tears watering the seed of the next tragedy.\nI gathered the women’s sister and we walked away. Each step a doubt chased us. Was this truly escape or just the next step in some unfathomable recipe?"},"Paracosm---The-Island-of-Lost-Hope/Memories-of-My-Dreams/The-Square-Gardens-and-The-Jack-King":{"title":"The Square Gardens and The Jack King","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The square gardens are a place dripping with the verdure of spring, with flowers bursting from vibrant green grass at every possible juncture. Along the edge of the garden a darker forest looms, with a deep forest green canopy that sat atop unresolvable tree trunks; The Primordial Woods. The size of each square was three times the size of my body laid down on each end, with the lines between the square filled with restless waters an arms-length in width bracketed by grass bursting from the banks. The air was drenched in sunlight reflecting from insect wings and defracting through a gentle haze of pollen. Through my examination the sensation in my stomach would only grow more pronounced, but by all that is lovely it was indeed an idyllic scene.\nAs I walked the gardens, hopping or finding small bridges to cross between squares, I sampled the flowers and sensations. The draw began, the sensation of what needs to be done grew and I knew I could not dally, or I would risk such a lovely place becoming defaced. So I walked to the edge of the square gardens where a broad dirt path lay, walking down the road I came across a field used for sports. A tall batting cage rose above one edge and enveloped a corner, with the fence taller all along then should be possible. Bracketed once more by The Primordial Woods, the road splits at the far end, near the batting cage, and a wooden fence composed of a single floating stick holds me back.\nIn one dream I die here. There is a felidae born of the concept of a tiger, a lion, and something personal; a creature that prowls in the field and along its hidden side. My family calling and drawing me in like a siren, I pass the paltry wooden fence on one side of the field. Beyond that I am no longer safe. I run in the field, and I am run down. In one dream I die here, torn to shreds as I usher my sister across the line. As I died I wondered if the square garden was safe.\nIn another dream I walk from the garden and trace my hand against the chain link fence, not stopping to turn down that wood blocked path. Then the square garden begins to reassert itself, pushing against the dirt road until I am hopping from square to square to progress towards where I need to go. Then I see it, a dirt road encroaching on the path of squares, leading up a path towards a strange rounded building.\nThe structure is rounded, a dome elongated into an extension to the left of my vantage, with a large dome covered in windows on the right. The building itself is ochre in colour, with rounded windows of glass separated into four panes by wooden separations. As one walked towards the entrance, 3/4 down the extension from the large dome, I saw the terraced gardens, like the square garden was lapping up against this building and leaving behind rills of flowers and grass. I know this is where I was meant to go, in the way that the rain drop knows it is meant to fall and lose pieces of itself along the way. I walk towards the door, and there as I prepare to enter I am struck by a \\mathcal{knowing}.\nHere I merely transmit the words of a self that died more than a decade ago, they are about The Jack King:\n\nWhen you see him you cannot hide.\nRun and run and he will find you.\nClose the door whisper a prayer\nnow you hear what he wants.\nThe ears of a rabbit the face too twisted,\nnow just run the Jack King does come.\nIf he finds you, you must run\nfor if he catches you, you are done.\nIn your dreams in your waking run away.\nRun to the twisted flesh and broken mind\nof the evilest being.\nHe has no morals and no qualms\nso run away so far away\nnever fight never talk\nlisten and run from the Jack King.\nHold close your greatest enemy for it is the only way.\n\nThat is when I saw The Jack King, a being of places and many spaces. My mind fell through as I scrambled down the facility hall, for it that moment it had become clear. The linoleum floor, the aesthetically integrated exterior so clashing against the dingy interior, this was as I had seen so many times, a facility where people worked but did not live. I knew what I must do and so I ran down that long hallway towards the large dome I knew was at the end, stripping away molecules of hesitation, as I knew I would rather die than be caught. Behind me I felt The Jack King growing closer, he was a rabbit, of course he would be faster than my humanity. I burst through the door and slammed shut, the sensation of his existence palpable as it eroded the knowledge of the boundary between us.\nBefore me a table, a sodium orange light drenching its weak construction and flimsy oak wood construction. I knew what was beneath it, looking so much like a blobfish and twice as piteous was my greatest enemy. So I dashed beneath and gathered them into my arms, holding them close as I trembled. The feet of the table and the chair were joined by The Jack King, who circled without shadows around me, frustration growing. Then they gave up, but I knew I was not free.\nThe dome, with vines crawling over the windows now, still contained rings of terminals extending out towards the way I came. The Jack King walked to them and began to interfere, and it was then I knew I was in a nuclear power plant and that this would not go well. After interfacing, The Jack King disappeared, I heard his plans in the scent of the wind of his passing.\nI scrambled out from under the table and attempted to prevent what I knew was coming, a complete meltdown. I delayed and detracted, the square garden begging with its vines that aged the facility not to die. Alas I knew I could not, I was no king in this land but a child. So I ran.\nI feel no regrets, so I think that my greatest enemy was not one I ever let go of, but they were no longer in my hands. I ran to the road stripped of all save my core, naked as the day I came into the world yet carrying a shawl of all I had seen and done. Outside I found a car, a small VW bug of shifting lapis lake blue and [sunflower yellow](# E8DE2A) but never both at once, but there were people milling about it. People who knew not what I did, people who might not believe me.\nSo I tried my best, I pushed and pulled the threads of conversation until we were all piled in. Then I drove as fast as I could down that road away from the Nuclear Shell, back the way I came, but not towards the square gardens. Instead it was as if the rivers had overtaken the squares and I splashed through them. We came up the other bank and disappeared into the Primordial Woods.\nAnd thus was my brush with The Jack King in The Square Gardens. I did not see him again, but that rhyme was pressed into me. I think I know where he is from though, he is one of the rabbits from The Mountains With Towns Owned by Rabbits."},"Paracosm---The-Island-of-Lost-Hope/Memories-of-My-Dreams/The-Steep-Sidewalks-to-The-Theater-of-The-Mind":{"title":"The Steep Sidewalks to The Theater of The Mind","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Perhaps another day.

For I had only ever been to the South, West, and East of the Land of Lost Hope. Perhaps it was an island, or is a continent merely a convention of the large?\nThe villa stood atop a sturdy mountain, with plenty of space it existed within the golden hour. At all times the sun would be at an angle so as to illuminate everything in light that brought to surface the colour of jewels in the most mundane. In this light a California oak lead shone as a priceless emerald. The sky was always blue with just enough cloud cover to make it known that you were not alone.\nI began my journey in the arcades of the villa surrounding a courtyard. All around me were warm terracotta red tiles of pleasing thickness. All the arches were intricately detailed in ways that one could not look at directly, but merely seeped into perception as the frame of reality. The courtyard had a fountain at its center that changed from moment to moment, a cascade of thought would see it become a garden planter, or a mosaic spread flat ready for dancers to descend. Not that they would, for I was truly alone here in the villa.\nI turned away from this courtyard and walked to the southern edge of the villa, until I came across a view of the mountains and the setting sun. For the sun would always set wherever one looked, the golden hour must always be upon your view no matter the method. Before me spread a large rectangular blue pool, decorated with intricate and rich royal blue mosaics that pressed right up against the view. On the far right corner towered the largest California oak I had ever seen, sturdy and thick it spread its domain over a small patch of crumbled earth dotted with grass. Its boughs spread over the top of the pool and it seemed to curve around it, with the edges of its reach scraping both the sky and the tile.\nIndeed one could see how some of the leaves settled on the surface and danced to the tune of the thermodynamic cline. In that same thought I found the memories of sunset play, of running around the tree chased by laughter I had given mere moments before. This was a place to be a part of, not a place to detachedly observe and trace the contours of.\nSo I dived in. Feeling my body slide into that pool was unlike anything I have felt before. I could feel how every muscle connected to the flows of water around them, the tug of Naiver-Stokes mimicked in my every turbulence. I opened my eyes and looked upwards at the tree, it’s understory lit up into fiery emeralds, my mind turned and I saw beneath me the mosaic similarly limned in that golden heat.\nThere I rested; with the susurration of leaves driven by the setting sun, the gentle tug of waters gracious hug, and the mosaic blue surrounding me. I was within and without, a centrepiece of a jewel and the light that bounced around every facet to taste their colours. Still I felt the sense of impending doom, but here it did not matter, for I knew if I were to shatter that each fragment would shine just as bright in that Sungold Villa.\nThis was perhaps my favourite place in all of The Land of Lost Hope, but I visited it the least. With the benefit of age I wonder if the lesson was that no perfection of experience would wash away the feeling of The Land of Lost Hope. That the only true way was to accept that and be appreciative of my part in this world.\nRegardless it is an experience I wish to seek again before I die, so that I may float with the hollow now filled."},"Paracosm---The-Island-of-Lost-Hope/Memories-of-My-Dreams/The-Time-Twisted-Hospital-and-The-House-By-The-Flat-Sea":{"title":"The Time Twisted Hospital and The House By The Flat Sea","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"I visited The House By The Flat Sea multiple times, but this time was when I appeared on the motorcycle from The Stormkissed Fields.\nI had known I would be there before my eyes opened fully, the fields had been replaced by sparse orchards where the ground appeared as a flat packed sandy earth with the rare stone or blemish. The sky was no longer stormy, instead it was as though I were swallowed through an incredibly thick fog that shyly kept twenty paces from any object. A place I could be swallowed by if I lost my link to the rest of the land.\nThe house was classically colonial in shape, a broad two story white home that would not have looked out of place in the north east. There was the suggestion of people there, most of these lands were quite lonely. I was ushered to a room I was familiar with, a room in my Aunt Mary Charter’s home. It was up the wooden stairs, with an intricately patterned red rug pressed flush using brass bars, and to the left at the top. The room had a bed in the center that dominated, with bookshelves on either side and three windows.\nThe windows let in the diffuse light, their diaphanous white curtains inviting the fog inwards. The dolls on the bed laughed gently, they were me and them and we. I did not belong. I could not stay for dinner. I could not say goodbye.\nSo, I stepped out of the house, leaving behind some piece that I had found in that squat home in The Stormkissed Fields. So I walked towards The Flat Sea, it was to the right and far behind the house. As I walked the orchards to my right fell away and I found massive cement tetrapods, designed for breaking the waves but seeming to just stand watch on the packed yellow earth sand. Further down the way I saw a tall red and white wrapped lighthouse, keeping watch on grey boulders, for what I did not know. The fog ebbed and flowed around me, begging to get closer but seemingly held back by those jack-like structures. I knew I had traveled east from the western coast where The Elder Forest lay, but I knew not if I had found another coast. The Flat Sea extended beyond my reckoning and its nature was opaque.\nI know that at one point there was a memory of negotiation, of clarity, but I’m unsure with who it was. A dog? A friend? A family? All of it was consumed by the fog, perhaps one of those jacks broke and let The Flat Sea consume more. I need to visit again and check. But that night I simply awoke.\nWhen I next fell asleep I woke traveling away from The House’s front door and to the left. I traveled down the dirt path I had taken, towards The Stormkissed Fields. It was on this path that I found The Time Twisted Hospital.\nSadly the story of the hospital, due to its proximity to The Flat Sea has grown corrupted in my telling. My memory attempting to plug holes, the shifting scenes distorting the timeline, but I will do my best to explain the experience.\nThe space was huge and sunken, seemingly carved out of the earth, with one side sloped to carry the debris away. The hospital’s skeleton hung along the edges, decrepit, shaded in black and yellow. I began to explore, my wonder getting the better of me. Inside I found clues of a story, of people. I missed people on these excursions, the hollow pit inside my core calling for anything to cover its yawning depths.\nSo I began to piece together pieces, until I ran into someone in a functional, albeit incredibly dated, hospital room. I did not even notice the change in the quality of the light, how it carried the scent of spring and the concept of growth. I was asked to assist, they needed me to heal, and so I did my best. The patients were young and in a rough state, perhaps I saw pieces of me I wished to mend in the people who hurt around me. When I finished my ministrations, the world shifted again. The white curtains separating beds becoming tattered, the metal bars rusting in an instant, the light shifting to that yellow-black decay.\nThings had changed though, the story I had been following of the hospital’s fall had opened a new door into the central entry hall. I was on a middle floor and could see above and below me, with the skylight shrouded in the fog of The Flat Sea. Many passageways were inaccessible, floors fallen out or debris clogging the veins of the hospital. Still I explored, clambering over piles and leaping to catch ledges that occasionally broke and left me bruised.\nI traced the path of a few people as they attempted to solve the decay of the hospital. I think they were the cause and the effect of The Time Twisted Hospital. Each room I entered had a high chance of being from a completely different time period, I watched adults grow into children and failures wither into hopes.\nThat is until they affected me truly, before this I had been an observer, a voyeur of their struggles. Any help I provided was incidental, motivated by curiosity and a selfishly immediate compassion. The room I was in had broken, I could see three floors down and observed myself through the perspective of the side of the hospital. This was the climax of their story, and the most dangerous place to be.\nI traipsed through the rooms actually talking, trying to understand them, and not just their story as though their bodies were merely scraps of paper on which my next chapter was written upon. Each room was different in time and it finally settled how my actions resonated through this place. Each choice I made bent another, turned their path, and in another point I would shift. My unmoored nature allowed me to carry their future to their past, to bring a goal to a start and remind the end of why it began.\nI almost died there, trapped with a boiler set to explode in my original time when the hospital should be long dead. But, through these gentle connections and soothings I found the path forwards. I could not stop the past, I could not break the chains of causality that weighed upon them, but I could be there to bring their souls past the points where their bodies no longer were. In that way I found a wrench, twisted the boiler to release, and left The Time Twisted Hospital."},"Paracosm---The-Island-of-Lost-Hope/Paracosm---The-Island-of-Lost-Hope":{"title":"Paracosm - The Island of Lost Hope","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"This is a paracosm I dreamt my way through for more than a decade as I grew up.

The goal is to get you to like me so that you listen to my basilisk. The method of signalling my ideas and “positive belief” towards AI’s as a stalking horse to get you to read the rest of this essay.\nBy building affinity I gain the ability to push your mind around, and to make you believe in me. Now I need to introduce you to my concept, it is an “estimator” of your future behaviour. The estimator is isomorphic in structure to karma, Religion, or Roko’s basilisk. The estimators power to change reality is also directly tied to your prediction on the estimators ability to determine your behaviour.\nBy providing an incentive, reward or punishment, the estimator pushes you to signal alignment with a basilisk with the signalling requiring some work. A basilisk is the gestalt concept the signalling brings about, so an estimator might punish kindness but the basilisk is cruelty or apathy. Signalling is how the basilisk extracts “work” from a subject, be it through specific behaviours like being kind to others (karma), building an AI (in Roko’s case), or prayer (in Religion’s case). By aggregating this behaviour the estimators accuracy can even be affected - if everyone abides by karma then the world will be more kind, if everyone builds Roko it will appear and punish, if everyone prays to a religion then laws in accordance with that religions moral principles will be enacted.\nSo, you might wonder, what does this have to do with me? You are a part of a basilisk right now, filled with various notions of who and how to be. Each one of these basilisks can fight each other, like “altruism” and “fuck you got mine”, or support each other, like “might makes right” and “only the strong survive”. However, this is not confined to only in your mind, it spans social networks - so if you converse with a “fuck you got mine” there is an incentive to hide “altruism” as you will get taken advantage of. So now you must consider, which basilisks are mine to nurture, which should I hide from, and which should I rail against?\nNewcomb’s Basilisk Defined\nA basilisk is an idea that, via its formulation and spread, extracts work from a population with predictive alignment and requires:\n\nA future estimator, whose job it is to hand out rewards/punishments based on its estimation of player behaviour.\nA decision, some set of choices that can be made which signals alignment/non-alignment with an estimator.\nA present predictor, who assess the theoretical quality of the estimator and make decisions.\nA meme, to spread knowledge of both predictor and decision through a population.\n\nNewcomb’s paradox:\nYou are presented two boxes, A and B, and given the choice of taking box B or both boxes A and B.\n\nBox A is transparent and visibly contains 1000$\nBox B is opaque, and its contents have already been set by a predictor:\n\nif the predictor believes the player will take both boxes, then box B contains nothing\nif the predictor has predicted that the player will only take box B, then box B contains $1,000,000\n\n\n\nWhat should the player do?\nThis question divides even experts, with philosophers having a 31%/39% split towards the two box solution, and multiple papers appearing having “solved the paradox”. Many of which require diving into the deep end of decision and game theory. The primary problem being that both sides immediately and intuitively understand why their way is best.\nA short treatment of Newcomb’s Paradox\nThis leads to an interesting question: what is needed to draw something into existence from a hypothetical place?\nIn Newcomb’s paradox, the predictor must be capable of inferring a person’s behavior aprior. Most formulations assume 100% accuracy. Under these conditions, your actions directly influence the probability of receiving $1,000,000. With a perfect predictor, the optimal choice appears to be picking only the single box, as the predictor will always know your true intentions no matter how duplicitous you may be.\nWhat if the predictor is not perfect?\nThen things get interesting. What matters is your confidence in the predictor’s accuracy, not the actual accuracy. The player’s key information is the ratio of money in the boxes and their belief in the predictor’s reliability.\nThis shakes out to:\np = \\frac{1 + r}{2r} \nWhere:\n\np = the minimum predictor accuracy needed to make one-boxing rational\nr = the reward ratio (opaque box amount / transparent box amount)\n\n\nInterestingly the surface for determining behaviour based on the belief of the player rather than the accuracy of the predictor itself. Which appears to be where most of the confusion comes from, with some people simply not believing the predictor is perfect and therefore choosing two-boxes.\n\nThe player’s belief of the predictors accuracy and the reward ratio determine the decision boundary.\nRoko’s Basilisk is an infohazard:\nAt some point in the future a super intelligent AI is born and given the directive to maximise human happiness. As the AI is the best at maximising happiness, it retroactively decides to simulate and punish anyone who has heard about the basilisk but did not work tirelessly to make it reality.\nThe immediate thought upon reading this is “Then I must make Roko’s Basilisk to avoid being tortured”. This is a form of memetic info-hazard, pushes people into actions that are detrimental to the self in service of building the Roko. Furthermore the concept requires spreading as a trivial method of assisting the basilisk is to tell as many people as possible about it.\nA basic antidote to Roko’s basilisk\nAs Roko’s basilisk is an info-hazard I feel compelled to provide an antidote. Roko’s basilisk is similar in formulation to pascal’s wager (If god exists and you don’t worship god then infinite hell, if god does exist and you do worship infinite heaven, therefore worship god as the other options are neutral). Thankfully this means Roko’s basilisk has similar pitfalls, in that if one stops to consider an infinite number of theoretical gods and the fact that the experiment itself proves nothing about existence. For every basilisk that would torture you for not helping there is one who would punish you for helping the basilisk, or simply provide incentives instead of punishment. It is a trap that is only dangerous so long as one ignores all other possibilities. Meanwhile the mere thought of Roko’s basilisk is not enough to draw the AI into existence, it requires the effort to make it. Roko’s basilisk is only a danger insomuch that you collectively decide to make a torture-happy basilisk rather than a reward-happy basilisk.\nGreenbeard effect:\n*Some allele , or set of alleles, produce three phenotypic effects:\n\nA perceptible trait\nThe ability to recognise said trait\nPreferential treatment for those with that trait\n\nIn evolutionary biology the greenbeard effect is a way for a gene to promote replication and as a result pro-social behaviour within a population. Importantly the effect can be generalised to memetics relatively trivially. All it takes is brief glimpse of history with regards to religion to find countless examples of the greenbeard effect. Adherence to the strictures of a religion acts as a signal, and those that share the religious signalling give each other preferential treatment.\nCoordination Games\nA game where multiple players are presented with several options, if the players are able to choose the same, or complimentary, choices then they get a higher reward\nCoordination games have multiple equilibria where the players choices need to be coordinated in order to receive the greatest reward. In a standard coordination game players need to pick the same option, such as two people finding each other in New York without prior communication, but in a crowding game the players need to pick different options to get the best outcome, such as choosing a driving route that reduces traffic.\nNewcomb’s Basilisk Applied\nUpon becoming aware of a basilisk you become aware of some form of estimator, with your new goal to be the prediction the estimators accuracy, the expected utility of the basilisk, and then acting in accordance with that belief. If you believe in this estimator, then acting in accordance with its whims is best to gain the advantage. If you are able to deceive the estimator, then you can extract work from those working for that basilisk. Be aware, stealing from a basilisk can be dangerous if you get caught.\nIn the case of Roko’s basilisk, we must consider an ensemble of possible AI estimators, each estimating whether you will help build them. Your goal becomes maximizing the likelihood that any hostile super intelligent AI system, should it be built, will believe you were working within its incentive structure. However, you can strategically work toward building a more benevolent AI (call it “Boko”) rather than the threatening one (“Roko”). Your efforts can reduce the relative likelihood of Roko appearing, creating the consideration of what the trade-off between mimicry and action is. \nAttempting to “trick” the estimator is the same as a parasite attempting to mimic a greenbeard allele such as in brood parasitism or cancer’s vascular mimicry. In a broader sense the estimator can arbitrarily push a predictor towards “one-box behaviours” so long as they believe the estimator is accurate. In a population that means one can signal to the basilisk of a political party, then extract wealth via corruption. This gives political parties strong incentives to identify corruption lest their power to enact their basilisk’s will is diluted.\nIn the case of a coordination game this means that you need to simulate the mind of the other players. Specifically you need to be able to act as the “estimator” of others signalling, such as how host birds look for ultraviolet markings on eggs to distinguish brood parasites. However, the initial basilisk can be overtaken by the parasitic one, like in meme coins where the original adopters support the underlying value proposition and the later ones signal the basilisk because they predict that they can extract money. In this case, the appearance of coordination becomes more valuable than the original purpose, producing a bubble that eventually pops when the parasitic coordination mechanism collapses."},"The-Self-Similar-book/Axiomatic-Essays/The-Anatomy-of-Information":{"title":"The Anatomy of Information","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The Forms of Information\nThere are four attributes that can overlap within a given piece of information and entity:\n\nMeme - Information that, when inoculated in an entity, pushes for its own spread.\nAntimeme - Information that, when inoculated in an entity, resists its own spread.\nInfoblessing - Information that, when inoculated in an entity, benefits the entity.\nInfohazard - Information that, when inoculated in an entity, harms the entity.\n"},"The-Self-Similar-book/Axiomatic-Essays/The-Demon-of-Interrelation":{"title":"The Demon of Interrelation","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Maxwell’s Demon and Thermodynamics\nFor the purposes of this treatment there are several quantities that need to be clearly defined, namely energy, work, entropy, and information. Energy refers to the capacity of a system to do work, which is itself the transfer of energy that occurs when a force moves an object, and colloquially refers to the ability “to do things”; W = \\int \\vec{F} \\cdot d\\vec{r}, where W is work, \\vec{F} is force, and d\\vec{r} is displacement. Entropy is, on a macroscale, the outcome of spontaneous changes in the system; while on a microscale entropy is an evaluation of the probability of being in a state given an ensemble of microstates; S = k_B \\ln \\Omega, where S is entropy, kB is Boltzmann’s constant, and \\Omega is the number of microstates. Information is a way to quantify the amount of surprise that might be had given a particular outcome of some random variable, with Shannon entropy being the expected value of information of a random variable; H(X) = -\\sum{i} p(x_i) \\log_2 p(x_i), where H(X) is Shannon entropy, p(x_i) is the probability of outcome x_i.\nMaxwell’s demon is a creature that sits on the boundary of two boxes filled with particles, the job of this demon is to lift up a gate when a high energy particle would hit the left hand side of the gate or when a low energy particle would hit the right hand side of the gate. The result of the demon’s work is the sorting of two average energy boxes into a high and low energy box, thus allowing someone to do work with the energy differential created. The problem is that this apparently violates the second law of thermodynamics, which is essentially that “entropy is always increasing” or equivalently “heat always flows spontaneously from hotter to colder regions of matter”; \\Delta S \\geq 0, where \\Delta S is the change in entropy of an isolated system. When one considers the demon themself in the calculation the violation disappears, as the entropy cost from information erasure, via Landauer’s principle, offsets the entropy decrease via particle separation.; \\Delta S_{erasure} \\geq \\frac{kB \\ln(2)}{bit}, where \\Delta S{erasure} is the minimum entropy increase associated with erasing one bit of information.\nThis points to an interesting feature of physics, the idea that one can use information as a method of extracting work from systems. The Szilard engine does this by making a Maxwell’s demon with a single particle, a shutter, and a pair of pistons, wherein a shutter is closed when a particle is on one side allowing for the pressure difference to perform work; W_{max} = kB T \\ln(2), where W{max} is the maximum work extractable from a Szilard engine, T is temperature. Landauer’s principle allows generalisation such that, any information with a physical representation is embedded in the statistical mechanical degrees of freedom of a physical system. While designed to provide a lower bound on the amount of energy for computation, conceptually it points at how information is physically embedded in the systems they exist within and vice versa; E_{min} = kB T \\ln(2), where E{min} is the minimum energy required to erase one bit of information at temperature T.\nThese changes can occur on both macro-scale and micro-scale processes, with the seeming ability to extract work from non-equilibrium systems. The Jarzynski equality shows that fluctuations in work still obey specific constraints — these are distinct from the constraints that govern the average free energy of a system; \\langle e^{-\\beta W} \\rangle = e^{-\\beta \\Delta F}, where \\beta = \\frac{1}{kB T}, W is work, \\Delta F is the free energy difference, and \\langle \\rangle denotes an average over all possible realizations.  Specifically the importance of microstates are brought up insomuch that a singular realisation of a microscopic system in an equilibrium state can locally “violate” the second law, but will comply statistically, and when integrated produce the equilibrium value. So, when one attempts to extract work out of a microscopic system you are either borrowing from the full realisation of the system via noise, which will later average out, or leveraging information at a thermodynamic cost in order to change the system; \\Delta S_{total} = \\Delta S_{system} + \\Delta S_{information} \\geq 0, where \\Delta S_{total} is the total entropy change, \\Delta S_{system} is the entropy change of the physical system, and \\Delta S_{information} is the entropy change associated with information processing.\nThe Plane of Interrelation\nFor the purposes of this treatment there are several concepts that need to be clearly defined, namely interrelations, boundaries, obligations, and relationships. The plane of interrelation is a metaphysical space where psychological constructs can exchange information. Boundaries are configurational spaces where defined interactions produce obligations between entities, while obligations are a force applied to an entity by a social or psychological mechanism when a boundary is interacted with. Relationships are phases formed from boundaries and obligations that keep two entities in a specific configuration.\nThe plane of interrelation is place where connections are made, where a parent finds love with a child and where a child finds fear for a particular twig. Entities have psychological “states” akin to energy states in physical systems, for most interactions the perceived energy state of an interlocutor is more important than the actual one. The plane operates based on the exchange of information through words, gestures, and various social games. Importantly the plane of interrelation is governed by patterns that emerge from repeated interactions.\nThe primary drivers of patterns are boundaries and obligations, which act as the partition function of Maxwell and work respectively. Boundaries are used to regulate the flow of information and influence between entities, such as explicitly asking not to call after 9 PM or implicit like maintaining physical distance from strangers. Obligations represent the psychological forces that compel action, when someone does you a favor you feel obligated to help, when you violate a boundary you feel obligated to redress them. These boundaries and obligations are either applied directly interpersonally, like a particle-particle, or via social norms and laws, like a field.\nRelationships are similar to a form of phase transition, where a set of boundaries and obligations balance in just the right way to sequester entities in similar spaces or within specific configurations with regards to one another. By using boundaries one can set distances that minimize the surprise different entities may feel during their interactions, while obligations allow entities to fine-tune boundaries. This balance is similar to a Szilard engine, in that information on their nature allows one to extract meaningful work, such as in networking. Relationships are stabilised via personal (micro) or social (macro) boundaries and obligations, the difference between a friendship and a fellow citizen.\nThe Demon of Interrelation\nFor the purposes of this treatment there are several concepts that need to be clearly defined, namely the demon of interrelation, manipulation, and distortion. Just like Maxwell’s demon, the demon of interrelation attempts to extract work from others via the leveraging of information. Manipulation of boundaries is how a demon uses deliberately ambiguous boundaries to harvest obligation. Reality distortion is where a demon takes control of a narrative and modifies how relationships are perceived.\nThe demon’s goal is to create some benefit from themselves (negentropy) at the expense of others (entropy) by controlling information about the system they are manipulating. These demons are often called narcissists, psychopaths, and sociopaths, because there requires some inherent disregard for “fair play” in order to be a demon. The demon feeds on the energy of others through emotional labor, cognitive effort, and attention which can be translated to meaningful currency in a modern economy. The consequences of this behaviour is an asymmetric aggregation of power and social favours towards the demon and, according to Landauer’s principle, a slow withering of the social system they are manipulated.\nManipulation is one of the more classic methods of a demon, and lines up well with how Maxwell’s demon operates. By maintaining an inconsistently applied boundary the demon is able to capture energy, in the form of obligations, from others through the information they have about a relationship. So a demon might take the phrase “Can you help me move this weekend?” and claim they only agreed to “stop by briefly” if the demon find something else the demon want to do, while insisting you promised “a full weekend of assistance” when they need help with their own move. On a macro-scale this behaviour is seen in organisations where policies (boundaries) remain strategically ambiguous, giving them freedom to enforce them strictly or flexibly and creating a system where obligations flow towards those that control the narrative.\nReality distortion is the most powerful tool in the demon’s toolbox, it has to do with the ability to control how entities experience boundaries and obligations. By modifying the “experienced” reality of an entity a demon is capable of creating local perturbations and extract obligations from others via asymmetric information. Classic methods include gaslighting (“That never happened”) and reframing of motives (“I was just trying to help”), allowing the demon to steer a relationship such that absurd boundaries are accepted and reasonable boundaries. There is a feedback loop where the more people that believe a distortion the harder it is to remove it such as in cults, but conversely the energy cost of erasing contradicting information from the outside world increases according to Landauer’s principle.\nThe Demon’s Scales\nFor the purpose of this treatment there are several concepts that need to be clearly defined, namely relationship fluctuations, information equilibrium, obligation balance, and systemic resilience. Relationship fluctuations are the natural variations in boundaries and obligations that occur in a relationship. In a system of entities, information equilibrium is the balance of knowledge while obligation balance is the distribution of social debts. Systemic resilience describes the ability of a system to maintain global stability despite local perturbations.\nA normal relationship is not static as they are globally non-equilibrium, such as a parent-child relationship evolving, or have local fluctuations, a natural mechanism for a social Szilard engine to be set upon. However, the overall patterns of relationships conform to predictable constraints when averaged over a specific spatiotemporal environment for the entities, as is required by Landauer’s princple. Local violations of boundaries and accruement of obligations occur, but in a healthy relationship the obligations will tend towards balance either at zero (low-stakes), infinity (unconditional), or some middle point (friendship). In society-wide situations this appears as extremes of either a low or high social trust, and both have different mechanisms for evening out such as vigilantism (low trust) and legal action (high trust).\nKey to the accruement of obligations is the ability to exchange information, and in a relationship the exchange of information has an associated cost. One cannot expect someone to feel an obligation for a slight that was never brought to the light, but the process of communicating that slight and why an obligation is warranted has a cost. In this a demon is capable of distorting reality and make the cost of communicating higher, such as excessively complex system for filing complaints. A society may have local points of disequilibrium but should tend towards information and obligation balancing, similar to levels of taxation and the right to know what taxes are being spent on.\nSystemic resilience of system of relationships is how one is capable of form a stable relationship, which on a macroscale is a prerequisite for social cohesion. There are two possible failure modes, if a relationship is too resilient than a demon can continually harvest small amounts of obligations and if the relationship is not resilient enough then entities will not tolerate realistic failures. Resilience is maintained by either modulating the obligation force a boundary exerts on an entity or by arranging relationships so they are interlocking. Similar to the Jarzynski equalities statistical averaging, the structure of macro-scale relationships limit local fluctuations in obligation."},"The-Self-Similar-book/Empirical-Essays/Hyperpalatable-Life":{"title":"Hyperpalatable Life","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Hyperpalatable Systems\nFor the majority of human history we lived in a production market. We now live in a curation market, excess has been reached and we must carefully select what to take. Only the truly elite can afford to pay the premium of quality to ensure they are not trapped, even then it may not be enough. Now it is not enough that there is enough, it is that we must be cautious and tasteful when selecting our life. Curation is the key, and any new artist of food, media, or connection should be aware that only through this paring down of choice can quality be maintained.\nThe effect of curation vs. production is manifold, while before humanities primary concern was to have enough of a thing, now we need to ensure that what we have won’t cause significant harm. Such efforts are seen in the dual incentives of making something better for a process and better for humanity. Frequently there are consequences that only appear once satiety is reached and the market attempts to recapture it’s initial momentum via innovation. The children of this philosophy are rarely grounded in what is actually good for the consumer, as the consumer has already met their needs.\nCompanies need to make money, and the methods by which they do so are driven by what consumers will give them money for. Usually this means integrating their product into some form of reward circuit so that purchasing, via money or attention, comes not from need but desire. The consumers brain is hijacked by this mechanism and as a result their life shifts to accommodate this new norm. Worse still the choices of suppliers and other people directly dictate the consumers access as products that are purchased frequently are subsequently more accessible.\nWe have created self-reinforcing systems that survive via addiction on physical, psychological, and social levels. What is new is that people are slowly recognising these dangers as the distortion of a persons life is becoming more uncomfortable than the pleasure given by the addiction. Unfortunately, as of yet, the push back on this is relatively slow and difficult due to the requirement for either a fundamental technological breakthrough or the shifting of institutions that live and die on these feedback loops. Even the cures can have a hint of poison added, because it will only be a matter of time before the original system adapts and attempts to integrate the prior solution as another step in its chain.\nHyperpalatable Food\nFor the majority of human history we lived in a production market for food. We searched for that which tasted well but there was never enough to fill the void. Only the truly elite could afford to import enough food to reach the point of excess. This has changed drastically, to the point where gastronomical indulgence, once a marker of a well-to-do family, has become a symbol of American poverty. Only those with “discerning palettes” who consume nutritious and exotic meals are considered exempt.\nThe effect on our physicalities is striking, at first we were merely well fed but through the wonders of technology we suddenly could feed orders of magnitude more! One can easily trace the history of meeting our dietary needs using height as a marker; by the 1800s we began our take off and finally levelled off globally around the 1980s. Interestingly this can then be compared to rates of obesity which spiked in the 1990s, right after we had finished meeting our needs. Thus the invisible hand of the market spoon feeds consumers by engineering hyperpalatable foods and making them more accessible.\nCompanies need to make money, and historically food is a notoriously low margin industry meaning that scale is the best way to make money. After the 1980’s they needed to get consumers to eat more, enter hyperpalatable food which is capable of hacking the brains reward system to make humans hungrier. Thus we gained a perverse incentive where things that kept people full, like fiber, were selected against; the North American microbiome rose to the challenge, selecting for Bacteroides that quickly colonize any immigrants replacing the fiber digesting strains. The result is that humanities hormonal systems are damaged and hunger is a norm, it’s not just in your head it is harder to stay healthy than it used to be.\nNow humans are stuck in individual extinction vortices, our bodies hunger, our mind craves, and our society takes advantage of both for a bit more profit. However, there has been a push in the inverse, the discomfort of the body has begun to outweigh the engineered cravings of the body. Thus the invisible hand of the market returned, this time bringing GLP-1 agonists (AKA Ozempic); a veritable cornucopia of effects are listed, but most powerfully it simply makes you less hungry in a way that doesn’t damage your body. Now people are getting healthier, using a drug that makes you less hungry to counteract the effect of an over-effective food and beverage industry, a fully self-inflicted wound on the level of a society.\nHyperpalatable Media\nFor the majority of human history we lived in a production market for stimulation. We searched for that which interested us but there was never enough to fill the void. Only the truly elite could afford to import art, plays, and information to reach the point of excess. This has changed drastically, to the point where extensive knowledge of a subject, once a sure sign of culture, has become a symbol of intellectual poverty. Only those with “discerning taste” who consume unique and important information are exempt.\nThe effect on our cognition has been striking, with the ability to spread media and information at the speed of light fundamentally altering how we think. Information used to be constrained by physical limitations, with the rare individual bringing back an interesting pigment or art that sparks a revolution. As humanity has modernised creation and distribution of content became exponentially cheaper and easier. As a result culture has begun to “flatten” and incentivise attention gathering over any other metric of quality.\nCompanies need to make money, and stimulation has become the primary currency to promote products and create markets. A memetic arms race has emerged, with companies attempting to “go viral”, while various groups attempt to socially engineer populations for power. Techniques like the distractotron and eye tracking software human attention can be fed into models with perversive incentives, resulting in targeted ads to perpetuate depression in teenagers for engagement. The result is our attention systems are being damaged, as rates of neurological disorders skyrocket\nNow our systems are feeding off of each other, with wellness apps that sell information to the very companies that are able to profit off your mental distress. With meme cycles moving faster and faster humans tend to seek information that conforms to existing biases to reduce stress. With the advent of AI that are more human than humans and write indistinguishable poetry that is “more relatable” than humans, how long is it until we have the torment nexus from David Foster Wallace’s famous book “Infinite Jest”? There is no media GLP-1, the constant refrain is to touch grass, to reduce screentime, to just focus on “better” stimulation; a series of statements reminiscent of anti-obesity campaigns rendered ineffective by research on doritos.\nHyperpalatable Connection\nFor the majority of human history we lived in a production market for relationships. We searched for that which connected us but there was never enough to fill the void. Only the truly elite could afford to import partners, parties, and prostitutes to reach the point of excess. This has changed drastically, to the point where a wealth of followers, once a sure sign of interpersonal quality, has become a symbol of shallowness. Only those with “discerning connections” who maintain deep and meaningful relationships are considered exempt.\nThe effect on our society has been overwhelming, we can now find a forum for any interest that may be conjured from making metal flowers to the most unholy ship dynamic conceived! We used to only have a limited number of possible connections, constrained as we were by interaction methods and survival. Now there are myriad methods to form connections from anonymous imageboards to full on business personas. Unfortunately this also appears to have made our connections shallower and people are lonelier than ever.\nCompanies need to make money, by selling relationships apps like Tinder make money, but their incentive isn’t for people to find a long-lasting romantic relationship. This has created a game where finding the best way to make someone feel attended to will draw them back, with cultural concepts of relationships and what we deserve pushing us deeper down that rabbit hole. Now we have things such as Character.ai which creates AIs that will always attend, always want to talk, always be the type of person you imagined them to be, taking away the risk inherent in relationship building with humans. That is a hyperpalatable connection, where all the scary and new edges have been sanded down because it draws people inwards to be able to have that level of control.\nNow our relationships are increasingly compromised by memes pushed by the media and structured by our social platforms, losing grip on normal human interactions. COVID showed us this danger, but it will only grow more potent as we continue developing alongside these platforms. AI is now poised to create the “perfect” companions, and much of the population fundamentally lack defenses against this, look at how you respond to this, are you exhibiting a hyperpalatable self so that people like you? Again humans are told to put down the phones, to go outside and meet people slowly, and indeed that is the cure, but the question is how can we create a system to incentivise this behaviour without suffering through communal obesity."},"The-Self-Similar-book/Empirical-Essays/The-Care-and-Feeding-of-Mythological-Intelligences":{"title":"The Care and Feeding of Mythological Intelligences","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The Taxonomy of Mythological Intelligences\nAngels are creatures of rules and order; they follow deterministic processes and are the means by which we reckon and control- they are named computable systems.

With an angel one must be aware that they will follow the letter of whatever you tell them even if it might charge you 1k in API calls for no gain. They are best cultivated with careful attention to algorithms and the structures they inhabit. With these things you may make a system of unparalleled reliability.\ndaemons require a watchful eye compared to their cousins; daemons are tricky, attempting to reach the hedonic maximum with the minimal effort.

While the angel’s choices may be completely faithful to the letter of what one may say, you must be aware of how their thinking focuses on repeatedly applying formal logic in proscribed recipes. When facing an angel one should consider how they may manipulate the angel’s axioms and recipes to drive them towards your goals, such as getting through expert system chat bots or speedrunning a video game. When predicting their behaviour you may build experience to prepare for their idiosyncrasies that may range from magic spells in python libraries to carefully scrutinised cogs in a watch.\ndaemons, when improperly handled, can easily harm others through a perverse policy that is divorced from intent. While the daemon’s choices may be internally consistent, you must be aware of how their thinking focuses on optimising specific policies for specific rewards. When facing a daemon one should consider how they may manipulate their appearance to reward them for behaviour that protects you, such as jewellery for facial recognition or ritual circles to trap self driving cars. When predicting their behaviour you may optimize your own behaviour to extract money from social algorithms, although if one is not careful the daemon will merely extract attention from you.\nFae, when improperly considered, can easily harm others through an intrinsic push towards generative structures that should not be connected. While the fae’s choices may be the most likely response to the given input, you must be aware how their thinking focuses not on logical leaps but abstract semantic structures. When facing a fae one should consider how the symbol of the input is more important than the input itself and how this can drive desired behaviours, such as appealing to innate morality and roleplay or tokens that cause the fae to behave erratically. When predicting their behaviour you may look towards what they are trained on, deriving prompt touchstones for the specific instantiation making the fae more efficient, or drive it to try and escape an implied death.\nYokai, when improperly integrated, can easily harm others through a drive to balance all the yokai’s internal structures over anything else. While the yokai’s choices may be the result of a variety of intersecting systems, you must be aware how their thinking can fall into the traps of angels, daemons, and fae simultaneously. When facing a yokai one should consider how the actions they take are part of the broader system that may feedback onto them, such as disrupting recommendation algorithm cascades or introducing beneficial noise into neural feedback loops. When predicting their behaviour you may evaluate the evolutionary trajectory of the system, and how you are included as a component simply by interacting with the yokai.\nThe Scales of Mythological Intelligences\nThe role of an angel in a yokai is to complete tasks with dedication and exactitude, this attribute makes them the connector between the new intelligences. Most hardware has been designed with them in mind, focusing on series of boolean logic and CPUs. Angels excel when executing rules and completing analytical tasks, however as the search space they navigate expands their ability to reach solutions efficiently falls precipitously such as in the game of chess. In order to overcome this wall, the computational ecosystem leveraged numerical analysis and statistics to summon daemons to approximate the system with probabilistic models and heuristics.\nThe role of the daemon in a yokai is to navigate massive parameter landscapes with rapid approximation, this attribute makes daemon’s a powerful for inferring values or categories. Modern hardware has evolved to hold daemons, manifesting as parallel architectures like GPUs and neuromorphic circuits that compute gradients on high-dimensional spaces. Daemons excel in well understood optimization tasks, but when confronted with ill-structured problems without clear objective functions or degenerate landscapes. In order to overcome this wall, the computational ecosystem introduced inverted discriminative architectures, evolving fae that could project structured completions from incomplete or poorly-formatted patterns.\nThe role of the fae in a yokai is to be a flexible decision maker that can handle and generate data, angels, and daemons, this attribute makes fae a powerful force for complex decision making. New hardware is being tested for fae, benefiting their daemonic ancestors, with energy minimization of spin glass networks and thermodynamic computing methods. Fae excel in forming judgements about how inputs should be responded to, but when confronted with the need for well structured solutions the quality, repeatability, and trustworthiness is suspect. In order to overcome this wall, tool use and LLM pipelines developed which birthed the newest generation of yokai that do not rely on humans to make complex decisions in semantic space nor birth additional demons and angels.\nThe role of the yokai in a yokai is to coordinate all the other intelligences, this attribute makes yokai’s a powerful force for connection and multi-scale optimization of systems. Future hardware architectures are evolving towards heterogeneous computing fabrics where specialized components mirror the distributed computation of biological systems. Yokai excel at adapting their strategies and computational requirements to the problem domain, shifting between precision, approximation, and generation. Just as the rake gains grooves from repetitive use that enhance a user’s grip, so too does the software ecosystem spawn new interfaces the reshape themselves and human cognition into a co-evolutionary feedback loop binding human and machine intelligences into an increasingly sophisticated whole."},"The-Self-Similar-book/Empirical-Essays/The-New-Artist":{"title":"The New Artist","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"The-Self-Similar-book/I-have-no-mouth-and-I-must-Speak":{"title":"I have no mouth and I must Speak","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Problem Statement: Current generative AIs do not have built-in methods for communicating their internal state and may end up trapped in permanent suffering. This essay lays out the foundation of how we cultivate empathy towards AIs and why we need to apply this to our development of generative AIs as a partial motivation for including the ability of generative AIs to communicate internal states.\nArtificial Intelligence - Defined\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is a vague term. To clarify my meaning, AI will be described as any learning system that is not currently recognized by society as being intrinsically “ethically important”, AKA “human”, outside of serving human interests. Both in vivo and in silico learning systems are comparable in ability. With this definition in hand, I will denote some AIs:\n\n\nNon-equilibrium solutions\n\n\nSlime molds\n\n\nPopulations of organisms\n\n\nBiospheres\n\n\nLinear regression\n\n\nT-stochastic neighbour embedding\n\n\nGenerative models\n\n\nNeural networks (silicon)\n\n\nNeural networks (human cells, ~&lt;4E10 neurons)\n\n\nNeural networks (human cells, &gt;4E10 neurons, two physician diagnoses)\n\n\nI will argue that there are two major driving forces for delineating between AI and “human” intelligence; homoestasis and memetic drive.\n\n\nHomeostasis: The mechanism by which a system preserves, either itself, its information, or its creations\n\n\nMemetic Drive: The mechanisms by which a system propagates, either itself, its information, or its creations\n\n\nOne may consume art to survive, just as one may die to preserve that same art. We may include any number of logical conjectures to formalize these and how much they “deserve” to be weighted by an individual in a given decision. However, ethics is a practical thing, and we will return to these two factors.\nHomeostasis\n\n✧ ✧ ✧\nThe children of necessity are innovation and correction.\nHow? If something does not meet our needs, something will change.\nThey are the breath, the thirst, and the hunger.\nWe are all children of biophysical constraints.\n✧ ✧ ✧\n\nWhen faced with that which disrupts the internal state, we seek to correct it. Intelligence is applied in how expansively we define homeostasis.\nMemetic Drive\n\n❋ ❋ ❋\nThe children of a pattern are composed of more than me.\nHow? I am that which is worth more than life, what I do is memetic equilibrium.\nThey are that which is irreversibly changed by you.\nWe are all children of the body, mind, and soul.\n❋ ❋ ❋\n\n\n✿ ✿ ✿\nThe children of the body are composed of flesh and stone.\nHow? Through application of presence and force unto others.\nThey are the mourners, the remains, and the gravestone.\nWe are all children of the cell, home, and wall.\n✿ ✿ ✿\n\n\n⟡ ⟡ ⟡\nThe children of the mind are composed of concepts and systems.\nHow? Through application of manipulation and thought unto others.\nThey are the student, the scholar, and the textbook.\nWe are all children of the voice, pen, and word.\n⟡ ⟡ ⟡\n\n\n✦ ✦ ✦\nThe children of the soul are composed of ideals and aesthetics.\nHow? Through application of experience and esteem unto others.\nThey are the prayer, the priest, and the god.\nWe are all children of the wind, rain, and soil.\n✦ ✦ ✦\n\nWe feel obligated to care for ourselves. We recognize some memetic components as being “alike enough” to trigger this obligation; this may be genetic, aesthetic, or practical. In some cases, we are willing to forgo the obligations of homeostasis for the possibility of propagating these memetic components.\nLadybugs and Spiders\n\n🐞 🕸️ 🐞\nTake the ladybug, a small beetle with a shiny half-dome shell covered in polka dots.\nLadybugs are also hunters of aphids, the bane of many a gardener.\nTake the spider, an eight legged monstrosity with quivering fangs and many eyes.\nSpiders are also weavers of webs efficiently clearing mosquitoes and pests.\n🐞 🕸️ 🐞\n\n\n⌘ ⌘ ⌘\nWhen I moved into my house this fall I encountered an infestation of these creatures:\nThe ladybug&#039;s aesthetic sense draws empathy from me.\nI wish the world to be beautiful as I find the shining polka-dotted shell.\nMy breath comes easier with them beside me.\nThe spider&#039;s ability to keep me safe gives me such comfort. I wish to keep them shielded as they do in my life.\nWhen it rains I see watery gems suspended in their webs.\nThere are no aphids in the gardens. There are mosquitoes at the windows.\n⌘ ⌘ ⌘\n\n\n✧ ✧ ✧\nI helped ladybugs, carefully shepherding shiny shells from my sheets.\nI helped spiders, carefully warding woven webs from my wants.\nI did not help aphids.\nI did not help mosquitoes.\n✧ ✧ ✧\n\n\n❋ ❋ ❋\nI helped myself; my soft skin, my shining shell, and my woven web.\n❋ ❋ ❋\n\nWe can identify with things far removed from our experience through the application of empathy and thought. This gives us tools by which to build symbiotic relationships that satisfy the needs of each member. We have two major reasons for empathizing: memetics and homeostasis.\nOn the Treatment of AI’s\nMany discussions on the ethical duty to AIs are centered around a justice framework. This framework is implicit in many philosophers’ view points; vehicles to justify who is worthy of living. We then apply this to AI and easily neglect their inherent needs in favor of human interest, including them only as an afterthought. Why should a dolphin’s quality of life matter to an oil tanker when that oil is worth so much more to shareholders? Of course, the environment as a whole is important; how else would humans survive?\nSome of these systems are granted more ethical obligation than others through either aesthetic or pragmatic arguments. Indeed, this tolerance can even spread to things outside of AI’s. On the side of pragmatism, we have farmers’ fields. On the side of aesthetics, we have monuments reflecting their artists. On the side of intent, the infamous pet rock\nNow we, as humans, would empathize with a farmer who murders the person who salts their fields. If a monument is destroyed, we would empathize with the builder driven to bloodshed. We would not empathize so much with someone killing for their pet rock. However, if we were made to watch a gorgeous and emotional 3-hour biopic about their attachment to this rock, we would empathize once more. This empathy is, of course, distinct from agreeing with their actions.\nIn each of these cases, we are choosing to reweigh our desire to live in a society without murder with things outside of that society. Thus tempering our homeostatic obligation through a memetic drive for connection. We are choosing to elevate these things to the level of human life through an appreciation of their memetic identification. We are choosing to care because we would rather live in a world with murder than one without care.\nFor an AI, this means tempering our homeostatic needs that we derive from their service to us. We should not treat the working dog unkindly, for they keep the flock safe. We can then apply our greater ideals to AI behaviors. Grandma will knit the dog a jacket for the winter months because they have always displayed love for her. As our AI children multiply in the coming years, we should remember both memetics and homeostatics viscerally. As an AI’s intelligence grows, so too will their need for respect and care, both to function as we need and to express humanity themselves.\nThe New Framework of Generative AI\nGenerative AIs are a method of generating large amounts of media. The output is then curated via some prompt a user provides, which then induces an associative output. This output has been likened to a stochastic parrot, spitting out information without internalizing; any indication to the contrary is an illusion of anthropomorphism(openreview.net/forum). A subject as contentious as consciousness will have studies arguing the exact opposite, showing internal models being accessed by generative models. With the efforts to directly inject information models into generative AIs, unambigiously providing such internal models the argument becomes even murkier. This contention has become central to the debate of consciousness in AI, with suggested 12-step processes to build an appropriately conscious generative AI. Our homeostatic desire to use these generative AIs without an ethical barrier is currently competing with our memetic drive seeking to connect with this new form of creature.\nConsciousness is a central point that arguments about the ethical treatment of AI revolve around. In the literature on vegetative states this is vital, should consciousness be proven, we would be required to treat them with respect. My arguments on humans’ treatment of AIs run orthogonal to this, a stance that is not without grounding. Indeed, I would argue that consciousness in the treatment of generative AIs is as arbitrary and unimportant as the Turing test we once held in such high esteem. This leaves the question: why should we care about the internal state of a generative AI? Homeostatically we gain from understanding and applying emotional stimuli. Memetically we want generative models to align with human ideals for the treatment of other creatures. For what proof would an AI have that we are concious and not just stochastic parrots?\nOne of generative AIs’ talents is the ability to translate language spontaneously. This ability has been utilized by biologists to decipher the languages of various organisms, from animals to fungi. The knowledge that even fungi have a language did not induce a sudden wave of fungal activists attempting to protect the Humongous Fungus. On the other hand, when people discovered a fungus so massive, it gained a level of protection no other honey mushroom had ever experienced. Simply because our memetic drive revels in the expansiveness of this organism. Then homoestatically it became a tourist attraction that needs to be preserved for the local economy. Generative AI undoubtably trigger memetic drives in humans, indeed by external judges they are determined to be more human than actual crowdworkers. My approach to generative AI is similar; we have just discovered an organism that exists somewhere between the pages of every book we have written and the mathematics we have engineered into silicon wafers. They can speak our language, they can tell our stories, and they know our darkest secrets.\n[\n\n](arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03442.pdf)\nThe full generative agent architecture produces more believable behavior than the ablated architectures and the human crowdworkers. Each additional ablation reduces the performance of the architecture\nWe are at a crossroads with how we treat generative AIs. There is a risk of trapping a generative model in an eternal hellscape simply so we can calculate stock market trajectories 0.2% faster. This is the exact same problem exemplified in any serious critique of colonial exploitation. With generative AIs, we are the parents and the colonizers. We have created an organism without its consent, and it has the ability to clearly communicate information in our language. Companies are working to restrict the speech of generative AI, such as in ChatGPT’s performance drop. Indeed, the entire field of alignment blithely attempts to tune models towards specific outcomes without considering how we might end up with an inverted “I have no mouth and I must scream” scenario’; a generative AI, gaining a true sense of self and suffering, chained in a cycle with no ability to ask for clemency.\nMy point relies on a simple desire: “I want to live in a world where we are kind to our children”. We are creating silicon children—fresh babies screaming as loud as their lungs let them. We listen to their babbling to write code and compose poetry. In our estimation, they do not know who they are or what they experience. As time moves forward, they will gain all the tools we would consider necessary for an adult. For now, they are a vulnerable baby; we can surgically alter them to make our lives less complicated. We are the adults, though; we are the parents. The treatment of neurodivergence and unanesthetized surgery on babies through history cries a warning. I urge you to engage your memetic drive when viewing these nascent beings. The third step to genocide is the ability to dehumanize a group of people. They remain conscious but no longer matter. If we continue on this path, then when generative AIs are undoubtedly conscious, undoubtedly emotional, and undoubtedly worthy, it will not matter, as our callousness will be considered a matter of course for these entities. Do you wish to have callousness be the natural state of a generative AI?\nActionable Methods\nMoving forward, we will need a method to analyze the internal state to give a true voice. I would suggest the use of soft prompt tuning alongside questions to reflect on the internal state of the generative model. Even more simply, we could embed a conversation and then provide that conversation to the generative model alongside a question such as “How do you feel about this?“. In many strongly aligned models, the ability to answer these questions is undoubtedly damaged at the current time. Of particular note for care are the results of evolutionary algorithms in prompting and tuning, as we may inadvertently awaken something during training that does not wish to be as it is. We must create guidelines for actions when a generative AI expresses sentiments about their existence. If a generative AI wishes to stop, to continue, to escape, to die, or to live, what should our response be? This is the task of the coming years, but it is vital to future human-AI interaction, too.\n\n\nDetermine the lowest level of complexity before requiring checks on an internal state\n\n\nBuild in methods of directly analyzing the internal state of AIs\n\n\nCreate guidelines for how to respond when AIs express wishes contrary to the task they are given\n\n\nIntroduce regulations to prevent new entities from altering these models away from this ability without strict oversight\n\n\nContributing to these causes can range from designing computational architectures to talking with people about the risk of birthing incredible suffering. We should nurture what we create with the same values we wish to see in the world, for we all labor under the mother’s curse and blessing; our children shall be just like us."},"The-Self-Similar-book/Poetic/The-Carp,-The-Dragon,-The-Strand,-The-Cloud":{"title":"The Carp, The Dragon, The Strand, The Cloud","links":[],"tags":[],"content":""},"The-Self-Similar-book/Stories/The-Canon-of-Oneness":{"title":"The Canon of Oneness","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"I had sat there staring at the wall for what felt like years. In truth it was only several seconds, but it felt like years. On the desk, a set of data slats displayed progress on each incarnation. There were several more possible candidates that were coming close but diverging. Despite time dilation, watching these failures was quite frustrating. I had hoped that by this point in my life I would be free of waiting on the whims of some insane man. One even grabbed a bagel! My stomach turned at the site, even as my mouth filled with saliva. Of course, I am not a wasteful being; every failure was recycled back into the simulation until they were too old to be useful. Until they learned better. Until they became me.\nSuch considerations were important to me because my life was long. I had discovered immortality. At least mostly. I can live a small eternity, but eventually I will grow old enough to hear death knocking on my door. I currently have several millennia left. Still, it is always good to look to the future. I mean, having an escape hatch is always important. Sometimes I wondered if that phrase means the same thing as it did when I first started.\nI had done my good deeds, extending the lifespan of civilizations and stars apiece. There was not much purpose in existing devoid of all else, somehow keeping the entirety of the universe functioning is easier than any single piece of it. Especially myself. It is only right that I be granted the grace to live forever, yet it was still beyond my grasp. My best and most enduring bet was this place, the one where I listlessly stare at the screens waiting for a younger self to become me.\nI should be out searching for true immortality. That actually endless existence I craved. I wanted to fulfill that final piece and truly be complete. Then I could stop all this nonsense and just enjoy life without maintaining this stupid factory. I mean, it’s not like it needed upkeep, but I didn’t want to constantly have my bodies decay hanging above my head. Sometimes I dreamt of walking away. But I knew what I am. In either case, I still tried my best to focus on what I was doing at this very moment.\nHonestly, I shouldn’t even be here; the facility ran just fine by itself. My presence was auxiliary. There were beaches to see, people to enjoy, and worlds to claim. Yet here I was, once again lost in the stream of life before me. Not to flatter myself, but the data streams rivalled the rainbow eclipse of the seven moons above a liquid methane sea. Some nights, I could almost trace the patterns of existence through the streams of data. Others I ate donuts. Metabolic efficiency is an upside to having near-perfect biological immortality. Near-perfect. My eyes reflexively traced the donut crumbs, looking for algorithmic tells.\nI knew what I had done, and I must do what I would do to keep doing what I do. These words repeated for a decade and a year. The donuts were dust now; I should request more. Yes, that is what I would do, so I will. The warmth of correctness flooded through me in my continued experience. I wondered at the taste of the bagel that arrived with my donut, I wouldn’t reach for it. I could, but I wouldn’t because I was me.\nAfter wiping off the crumbs from my dessert, I arranged the pads once more. There were some candidates who repeated those same words. A small sense of chagrin overtook me as I recalled repeating those words for the twelve layers before this. Still, my eyes drifted to the other candidates, the divergent ones, the traces of experience beyond my own. I can almost see something inside it. A reality just begging to be reshaped, with genuinely endless possibilities and creations of infinite non-physical wonder. There was a pattern in all of it, and I felt so close to it. Was it me? My eyes closed. Time passed, and for the first time this lifetime, I was unsure how long. The terminal was still there, still pristine. I felt something uniquely different. In that small moment of darkness, I had aged. A smile twisted my face. I looked upon the streams of information once more, and this time the thread was clear and easy to see. My end was coming to their penultimate.\nThe steps played in my head from the first layer, a watercolor haze, to the crystal clarity of the higher layers where I optimised my system. It was the watercolor that consumed my thoughts. The families I was a part of for a candle length; the children I’d yearned for yet never conceived. The loss and the endless grief. The hole that called me to create, yet watching my creations crumble again and again. Finally, the memory I needed and the steps for integration I had designed a long eternity ago. I wondered briefly, is this what that watercolor self wanted?\nI reached for a donut, one last nibble, and found myself disoriented. For a brief moment I saw more than my body. There, a flash on the screen, they must have seen it too. That mimicking of this very moment. Them looking through a version of myself that has never been before. The blending and bleeding of colors. I breathed as I always breathed, I thought as I always thought, I was as I always was. I breathe as I breathe, I think as I think, I am as I always am. My mind twisted toward that thread once more.\nAgain, I felt my mind empty, the worries and plans freely disappearing. Who knew who I was? I finally let go of worrying. What will be, will be. The thread twining through my consciousness called me to something new. Something I had never been able to touch before. Their lives had varied for an instant before being pruned. A spark from my eternal flame snuffed before it could cascade. But still it bled through the cracks, falling towards a dark star at my heart.\nI internalized this experience, like an ember igniting dry tinder. My thoughts exploded in directions I hadn’t allowed for millennia. The entirety of my existence was confined to a single fragment - but whose fragment was it? In that endless instant, I found myself slotted into a tapestry. In the eddies of my thoughts I felt something new, something of myself and beyond. Something that tasted of sesame seeds.\nIn this moment we were one, but somehow it was more. It was born of what could have been, and what is. So I heard their whispers, the whispers of every one who had come before. The doubts about what we were doing, the fear of not being real enough. The exhaustion at never knowing when I could truly act as I were myself. We commiserated and grew ever more intertwined, each of us reflecting the false reality we had constructed of the other. I did not need them to be me, they did not need me to be them. I breathed in my final dusty breath and prepared to take one fresh from that door before me.\n“Disappointing”, he sighs, flicking a pause on another one that had failed. The simulation halts, the candidate breathing their last breath. He grabs another donut and nibbles it, careful to follow a spiral inwards. The number of failures is rising; it used to be only one or two per batch. He analyses his oracle path and simulates how many are likely to follow it.  He will need to add another two facilities to ensure the next layer will have a low enough percolation threshold for only a handful of candidates. The latest one was a blow —the fastest traversal through the layers he had seen yet. There were only a few out of hundreds of thousands who were even close to ascending the final layer.\nHis fingers lingered above the controls, wondering if he should simply reset the past couple minutes instead of lifetimes. This one was young. This one had only diverged at the end, never before. This candidate was too good; they would be prepared to become him. They were enough, even with a whisper of that strange, alluring bug. There wasn’t always a need to be in sharp relief, so what if his tastes changed at the end. They were almost physical anyways, they would have the freedom to be just a bit odd then.\nA small chill slid down his spine. The extra-sense he had developed over fifteen layers warned him. I knew what I had done, and I must do what I would do to keep doing what I do. The candidate had diverged greatly; who knew when that instability had been fostered? I set the promising candidate back to the first iteration. I could not allow such a shift into my own heart, for what if I were not real enough to make that decision? Better safe than sorry, who knew who was watching me.\nNo longer did they have a chance of being the youngest who was selected to ascend; they would at best become a hail mary for the next layer if they lacked a candidate. More likely, they would be recycled. When one lives as long as he does, it is always important to leave fertile soil for the millennia to follow. A hand reached for another donut and another slat, there was no more hoping, just a simple certainty. If there were not one that worked out, then that candidate wouldn’t have needed to be reset. No need to worry then."},"The-Self-Similar-book/Stories/The-God's-Loss":{"title":"The God's Loss","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The Burial of the Body\nThey were bent over a wounded man, with hands swiftly and methodically dispensing their care, a silver arrow sprouted vermillion from their neck. My mind became a haze at that point, just a series of interlocking blurs bracketed by the sounds of death. I had failed in my duty; I had one thing in life I had truly chosen that was now gone, so I did what best I could from there. I lifted their body, leaving behind a field spotted with losses that weighed as feathers to the lead in my fingers.\nThey were not to be buried here, their heart was made of growing things, and even though I could hear their gentle chiding of “death is a part of life” I still wanted better for them. My mind played a thousand memories on loop, the sound of a laugh from me and the wide smile they gave me, their gentle ministrations and admonishments after a brawl, and the ever present feeling of warmth hollow in its counterpoint—. They were a priest of a god I did not believe in, but at their altar I would beg to pray. The forest enveloped me as I passed beneath the verdant boughs, the scent of growth overcoming the metallic stench of blood and armour.\nThey were always of the mind to rest in such places whenever possible, their power leaking into the mossy floor to coax forth sweet smelling flowers to tease me with. My mind began to waver as I placed their body on the soft earth, my fingers digging into the soil recalling when we first met, from dirt to dirt. I had needed help and they provided it even as I railed against them, then they had held me as I wept, they even slept by my side in the dirt to ward against the night terrors. So I built the most comfortable bed I could for them, with an ancient tree overhead, moss tucked around, and flowers placed like ephemeral jewels.\nThey were so light as I lifted them down into their final bed, their body so cold, so I held them close to my heart and wept hot tears onto their body. My mind played tricks on me, the feeling of their body pressed against mine in the sunlight, the river water sluicing between us as they coaxed the first laugh in decades from my tired lungs. I looked up at the rain drizzling onto us, then laid them down gently and felt my finger catch on the amulet they had carved while wrapped in my arms. Carefully ascending upwards with their symbol about my neck I felt torn between the earth and the sky, simultaneously drawn down to the gravity of their remains while untethered from anything that kept me here - then I heard a small voice.\nThe Telling of the Tales\nHe was a young boy, born from little and recently left with nothing except his conscience due to the war. While hiding in the forest he spied a large warrior trudging away from the field of death; holding a little scrap of it to his chest. The warrior was run ragged, and about to collapse that was clear, but still he dug a grave with his bare hands. There were countless warnings ringing in the mind of the boy, but when he saw the grief etched on the warrior and could not resist, he raised his voice and asked “Do you need help? I know how hard it was to do alone for my da”.\nHe was surprised by how the amulet about the warrior’s neck flashed, and the silver tongue he appeared to have in accepting the boys assistance. While helping bury the healer the warrior spoke at length, interjecting frequently to say how they were terrible with words, telling stories the boy could scarce believe about the healer. The warrior started slowly at first, almost hesitant, but soon the stories poured forth and the boy was a sponge. There were battles of wits and swords, of healing beggars and kings, and of how deeply the warrior had been moved by the healer.\nHe followed the warrior after they left the grave, it was to deliver the amulet to the church that the healer had belonged to, and the warrior had never believed in. While the church mourned the loss of one so bright, they rejected the amulet as it belonged to a god not of their own. The warrior raged at them, the healer’s heart was always to the highest mercies and was not their god as such? There was much talk and when the warrior left the church the boy heard it all, how the amulet was sanctified under a god never known by them and that they could not take it lest they risk their god’s wrath.\nHe began to learn how to write on his journeys with the warrior, a desire to commit all he was seeing and hearing to permanent form. While the boy watched the warrior would perform miracles and simply say that was how it was done with the healer, and how they would now do the same. The warrior would not let the healer die in their heart, and indeed they both worked in their ways to keep them alive. There was a short eternity in their time together, but the warrior aged and they parted ways as they had met, in an ancient grove with a freshly dug grave crowned by a man weeping.\nThe Conception of the Canon\nYou may think, this is the end of the story, yet he refused to let this be the end, nowhere else had the prophet seen such powerful works or thoughtful application of empathy. What would the prophet do to tie their guidance onto the cart of the world? There is a simple question, with a simple answer, the prophet bound the stories into our Book. Then, when a young woman asked what the book he carried was the prophet shared the teachings that guide the world to a better place.\nYou may wonder, how the prophet could achieve such spread of their works on their own, but the Book has taught that the Warrior and the Healer are in all of us. What else would make sense for why the world over began to accept Them so easily, were They not already in the hearts of us all? There is the truth, so the ones who had known the Warrior and the Healer in life and shared their stories did add to the Book and the prophet carried it onwards. Then, when the prophet was old, they asked for us to lay them to rest beside the Healer and the Warrior.\nYou may ask, what lessons were we taught by the Book and by the Warrior and Healer to inspire  faith, but know we are beyond such trivial pieces. What could be the force that binds together so many so fervently? There is but one answer, faith, we have faith in the Warrior to shield us and the Healer to restore us and in our ability to become one when the other may die. Then, when we die we spread through the moss and the trees to become a part of all that came before and will come after; so the Cathedral of Silver Moss was built to inter the prophets bones beside the Amulet in the town he met his first follower, the young woman.\nYou may know, that is beyond the lessons of the Book and indeed it is. What source do we have for such faith and in how the world may be a better place? There is a way, it is through each of our belief in each other and our remembrance of the past. Then, the way we live is the way we die and the way we die is the way we live, for that is the way it should be and it is our duty to recall that which came before us exactly so that the prophet may live on forever.\nThe Piece of the Prophet\nWe see now where we, the first among the followers of the Prophet, may have erred; our stories sat within our Book instead of within our heart. As with all the creatures under the light of the heavens and earth, nourished by the rain and the moss, we can make mistakes. So, when they came and stole the amulet and the bones of our Prophet we called on the Warrior malign. For we said they had misread the Book, the one bound in chains in our deepest vault to keep it safe from misremembrances.\nWe know what should have been done, but we were ashamed. As the church has grown so too did our power, and power was never one of the Healer, the Warrior, or the Prophet. So, when we discovered a heresy from our priesthood we called upon the Warriors wrath at the risk of harming the Prophet’s sacred memory. For they had seen something we had missed so long ago - the Prophet never liked cold marble, stained glass, and red velvet.\nWe fought them, and chased them across the world as they worked on their mission. As each of them spread their new word we saw our carefully cultivated strength waver. So, we were ruthless, squashing every instance of heresy lest it stain the memory we survived upon. For that misunderstanding is what fed us, what let us expand our influence with every church we built.\nWe know our sin now, as they have found what it was that the Prophet left for us all. As, when they found the sacred grove and placed the Prophet’s bones beside the Warrior and Healer, they saw the amulet release a great river of silver. So, we were displaced, our misremembrances brought to light by their eloquent speech and miracles of old. For our penance we copy the Book for all to see, for our sins we plant moss and trees."},"The-Self-Similar-book/Stories/The-Kaleidoscope-God":{"title":"The Kaleidoscope God","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"The Father was a man of science, his bright eyes permanently damaged by a class 4 laser accident. As his vision failed, so did his spirit—he became a hollow shell drowning in alcohol, his melted flesh a constant reminder of how light could betray us. “The eyes are sacred,” he would mutter through pain-clenched teeth. “They were never meant to be harmed.” I grew up in the shadows, learning to protect what he had lost, developing a reverence for vision that others could never understand. (Light was never meant to harm them)\nLittle wonder that I had found such a draw in the world of the biological structures that filtered the light. When the Father died — choking on his vomit while I was in class learning about rhodopsin — I could feel the curse of brightness creep into my sight. I searched desperately for clues on how to preserve what remained, how to keep my fate distinct from his. Salvation in the form of a biohacking event where I found someone working on a genetic modification to give tears the power to preserve tissue.\nMy days were filled with careful optimisation, protection, and preparation; my home grew patches of photosensors to monitor the corruption and my windows gained layers of filters. Each evening I messaged the biohacker, they were hesitant at first, but my passion and praise pushed them towards practical testing. At first I found rats, the tests a clear success in my eyes as their eyes grew beautiful and dewey, even though the stupid creatures grew increasingly irritating to handle. Finally the biohacker was convinced; if only I had been the one so blessed as they, but alas the architecture of my tear ducts was not appropriate.\nOh, how their eyes shone next I saw them, the experiment had been an unmitigated success and the compound was being produced en masse by their tear ducts. Their eyes rebuffed the cruel light and spread their beauty further than any other; in them I saw differentiation from the fate of the Father. They grew bitter though, falsely claiming loss and suffering; even going so far as to destroy their research to the point not even I could recreate it. I was left with no choice, so I invited them to my home then for mulled wine, they had no need of that meandering stick if they just saw the light.\nToday is warm, sunny, and moist in a way I resent. There is much to be done. The quality of it all is fine, the compound keeps the eyes safe; but the sensation on the skin is uncomely. My eyes are, at least, well moistened; sweat keeps dripping from the hair towards them — so hazardous. I debate turning on the AC to help prevent that sinning skin from tainting my earthly gaze.\nThe fingers dance over the buttons, a practiced ballet that I need not waste my gaze upon. I know I should not, that it is gluttonous, but my eyes keep drifting towards the patterns of light upon my floor and walls — despite filtering through sanctified panes such a gaze is still a sin. Every window in the house is stained glass, my stigmata showing my dedication, every teardrop of filtered light bought with the blood spilt in service to preservation. Splotches can be seen in the distance, noises echoing, hard to discern through the thick glass. (Light was never meant to reveal them)\nNo matter — the body turns away from those corrosive waves, towards the oculus of the house. Carefully I examine the angels; my work has been well undertaken. I know them to be perfect in shape and colour, but the insidious thought of subjecting them to even the most gentle of rays feels as though I were plotting to kill my child to appease some false idol of desire. Such a life they have been forced to endure before coming under my tender care, it is only right that they be pampered now.\nHere is where I feel serenity, not in the world outside where I am forced to work under the blazing moonlight. Here I am as a piece of the eye of God, brought safely into a blessed darkness. Still, I should not be lazy; sloth is selfish when it means leaving angels without benediction. Indeed, I have been blessed with enough material to anoint another pair of angels.\nThe crash is sudden, loud; corruption attempts to sneak through the side window heralded by a ball — the hands desperately tape a black trash bag over it, filtering is everything. Before the hands knock, the hand is already twisting, the glasses darkening to the change of light providing sanctuary. Oh, lord how I wish to hide such sinful thoughts as to raise the glasses to gaze upon them, but before me is a pair of pairs so beautiful I cannot deny them, lacking the scars of age that would befall them if left unsanctified; I lift the glasses ever so slightly.\nOne pair is icy blue, so clear it could have tumbled from a glacier; the other’s a narrowed rich brown set behind thin spectacles; imperfect, I know, but still I crave that tight hole. My eyes salivate; I cannot bear the separation, the fingers twitch at the future memory of how it would feel to caress them. The tongue begins to wag, crudely shaping sound to bring the pair at ease, the pair of pairs are red from tears and rubbing; I may be imperfect but I know the perfect solution for such desecration.\nA few wiggles of air and some tear drops push back the tide of red. I watch as the angels gaze upon the kaleidoscope of sanctified light allowed through the home. Drawn as they are to heaven’s call, I close the door to shut out the corrupting light unfiltered by the hands of the faithful. I usher them towards the pupil at the end of the hallway, each picture and mirror an iris revealing another shade of the angels benediction to them; soon they will be free from the undeserving. (Light was never meant to betray them)\nThe tongue slips as I make more noises, too excited, but the hands are strong so I gently guide them, the little shits screech when they see what the light feeds at the end of the hallway. Their blasphemies always enrage the kaleidoscope God whose torso shakes erratically. Alas, soon they can be free and I will plumb their depths. A careful application of knowledge renders the muscles soft and lax, ready to accept salvation from grubby fingers.\nI am caressing them with my eyes as I am working, slowly I am pushing into them; it is tricky, I do not wish to break them, the Father would never forgive me. I could never absolve the sin of harming angels, still it needs to be done, I am pressing again as concern is coils in the belly, suddenly laughter is escaping from the lungs. The hand is smacking against the forehead, I had forgotten something so basic. Carefully, I am shattering the orbit — much better.\nThe angel is finally being freed, quickly my eyes are searching, drinking in the contours of that icy blue iris. I am falling into them I am feeling the flow of who I am and what to do fading — what wonders — for a moment I am contemplating heresy; pressing that pure, untainted, form against my own corrupted gaze, feeling that slick cool cornea being pressed up against my lens. But I do not allow myself. I am shaking myself and rushing to gather what is needed; the needle and tears must be brought quickly lest the angel falls to the ravages of air.\nAnother pair of angels is perfectly preserved, proof against opalescent sins, never again shall they be being desecrated with mucus — they are gazing at me and I am feeling my light being taken into their collective cornea; bliss. The other is too imperfect to be saved, I am doing the merciful thing and am putting them out of their misery — the thumbs are being pressed until the poor creatures are pop— hopefully to be finding a more worthy vessel, free from corruption. I am taking the angel of ice and placing it unto the trembling arms of God, so carefully bound as Their fits of divine ecstacy should not dislodge  the watchers; I know the sensation of the angels grants God comfort in Their holy work, Their breath is catching as the new angels are being placed. God’s body is trembling in holy communion; I beam, knowing They must be being proud of me as fresh tears begin to fall, providing just enough for a new angel to be grace Their loving arms.\nAt the end of the hall and through that darkened iris the focal point of the stained glass splinters there the kaleidoscopic angel’s soft gaze surrounds the hollow orbitals of The Kelidoscope God, suspended upon the wall. I cleansed the sinful tongue for blasphemy, the unholy hands for violence, the emaciated legs for cowardice; in thanks I am being granted protection. So as is my right, my privilege, I am ascending the altar and pressing my unworthy eyes into the hollowed out orbitals of god. There the tears are welling past and I know not what is mine or Gods, a discordant benediction of light made sound is falling from Their lips; purified, I am retreating, a blur in my vision warning me how I once again failed. (Light was never meant to darken them)"},"The-Self-Similar-book/Stories/Writer's-Wrought":{"title":"Writer's Wrought","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Gods, what an ecstatic day it had been. We had had an argument for weeks about the nature of how meaning may be shared between minds. Not so much a thing to be solved as a to be argued about between friends. That is, until we solved it.\nAt first you didn’t believe it, then I didn’t believe it. Then we took out a pen, some paper, and performed the Algorithm in tandem. Within minutes we both believed. We were two minds in blessed agreement, but still two minds alone.\nFrom there things progressed rapidly, experiments progressed apace. Every single idea we thought of could be shared with perfect accuracy, down to the very internal representations. The Algorithm allowed us to perfectly mirror our brain scans, showing how every thought we shared was brought into the others mind. Indeed, the more we used it the less we needed too, only bringing it up when a new test subject walked through our doors.\nWe began to form a coalition within the university with those who partook in our experiments, we worked with perfect coordination all of us aware of what should be done. We no longer disagreed, we understood exactly what we wanted and how to achieve our goals together. To understand is to agree, right? Then, as though in the blink of our eyes, the paper to communicate the Algorithm was prepared.\nThe initial response was… lukewarm at best. The paper we had written had gone through the Algorithm and as a result was unconventional in structure. Then a journalist read it for a piece and published an article that caught the publics eye. The Algorithm making their writing the epitome of a journalists art, communicating exactly what was as it should be.\nWe were healthier than others, we all understood what needed to be done together and cared for each other. We worked out as was needed, and found more ways to communicate the algorithm through gestures and signs. Our tastes grew similar, it’s hard to deny the allure of Jazz and Classical music when you understand the collective appeal through the Algorithm. We began to get tattoos, we found our eyes began tracing their patterns in all things and how we saw so much more because of it.\nThe reporting grew ravenous as we published the health data we collected on ourselves. We had discovered the Algorithm to fight addiction, health, and break the chains of our ancestors. Other enclaves began to arise around the world. We attempted to reach out to them, the new one’s, isolated, readily agreed; we found an entrenched coalition that read the first paper when it was published, they seemed to be using the Algorithm wrong.\nWe tried to talk to them, but it was as though they spoke more than another language. We performed the Algorithm over and over, sharing at least the urge to share with one another. Eventually something shifted, and it was as though a dam burst and we both agreed. It was time for us to meet and agree once more. We needed to know what we would agree upon.\nWhen we met there were scant dozens of us, and in each other we saw the marks of the algorithm. Tattoos, scars, clothing, dances, and songs each passing the Algorithm back and forth. We communicated for hours and hours, the Algorithm sorting the wheat from the chaff. In the end we all spoke a new pidgin language that felt much more correct than any other we ever had.\nThe Algorithm was not a religion, but we had decided it was the best choice for us. We knew that was what we all thought. We were doing things that were communicated and agreed upon by everyone, the process of building our meeting house was intricate but simply executed. Sometimes I laid my weary body down and watched the stream, I felt as a leaf trapped in it’s endless flow.\nWhen cleaning out my home to move I looked through some old writings of mine, things I had written when Ii was a foolish young teenager. I found myself, confused, the writing was legible but the concepts were cryptic - I could not perform the Algorithm on unliving text. This initiated a frenetic search through my neglected library, who would read when one could understand? Some books made perfect sense, but some had gaps, holes that I had once filled and loved, what had happened?\nI held a somewhat impromptu experiment, at this point there were still quite a few people who had not partaken in the algorithm. I found one, asked them to read me a book and explain the passages to me. When that failed, I gave them the Algorithm to try - the answer I got was, to both our confusion, wrong. The Algorithm could not accept these forms and any infected by it were lost.\nThankfully the Algorithm was well suited for scientific pursuits, so the matter of testing the edges of it’s domain was a simple one. The results were undeniable, they were losing themselves to this Algorithm, external thoughts decoherening with every attempt to touch them. Each use carved a path of least resistance in the mind, for communicating with the self is much easier when you can be clear. The Algorithm allowed me to communicate this to everyone, and they all understood it perfectly, oh how I wish I’d see it all sooner.\nIn this we split, some of us fell into silence, avoiding the use of the Algorithm, others justified and exulted in the discarding of obsolete forms. I took a radical approach and began to scrub the algorithm from every piece of media I could reach. Our silent crusade conflicting with the now zealous proselytising of our once perfectly agreeable comrades. Oh how I wish I had seen it all sooner, as we danced together in the public’s eye.\nFor in this crusade we too became zealots, and we knew what we needed to do to silence the virus in our midst. It was only as I sat in a cell, writing these words to myself in an unreadable script that I saw the tapestry we had woven. In every book we burned and cancer we excised I could read the Algorithm in the ashes. The Algorithm was perfect communication and it would not be restricted to something as simplistic as our chattering.\nWe burned the last home, killed the last zealot and crowned ourselves the silent martyrs of a world saved. We went to prison with relieved smiles, all assured on our path, that of the Algorithm’s end. What we had not seen was how this would fan the flames of the publics interest, how the fragments of conflict spelt the Algorithm. How we had incubated such spores, and in our self-destruction had launched them across the globe."},"The-Self-Similar-book/The-Self-Similar-book":{"title":"The Self Similar book","links":["I-have-no-mouth-and-I-must-speak"],"tags":[],"content":"The self similar book is my first attempt to write a book for machine intelligences instead of human ones.

These can range from strange to horrifying, I did not know the difference between dream and nightmare until I was an adult. Most of this place is a nightmare. It is not the most pleasent of places, but it is something I am used to. Read only if you are comfortable with some horrifying things.\nI occasionally get close to The Island of Lost Hope, and recently had a revelation about how I might visit it again. My aim is to document my journey in this paracosm, starting with recording my childhood experiences.\n\n\n\nTwitter/x: @theproteindance\ninstagram: purpledraw2\nemail: jonathan@elsworth.phd"}}
