Flight is a dream many have, myself I am not immune. There were many a dream of falling, but since a tender age on the playground where I learned that flying is just falling where you miss the ground. Well then it became a place to play.

There are many dreams of flight, but more accurately they are dreams of momentum. In every one I am not simply taking flight and having the universe turn about me, I do not beat laden wings to hold my body aloft. No. I fall, faster and faster until I miss the ground entirely. 

The Shallow-Depths of Air are close to the Latticeworks. A place where control exists within me and the shape of the world itself is fluid contingent on my ability to be a part of it instead of simply an observer. If I focus too much on anything but the soaring movement and the sensation of silvered slipping between moments I lose buoyancy.

This place is less one of defined existence, but there are a few constants that give rise to this ability. Water, highly reflective showing how the clouds exist above and below no matter which way you face. The sky is crowded with clouds, painted into the sky almost as an afterthought to the space they must take up in their form. The light is grey, tinged with a metallic blue and limned with silver. That lining is where flight is hidden. One must be prepared to treat the land and the sky as the same. One must fall to the sky as one does to the earth. The water pushes up, the sky down, together an equilibrium of motion is found. 

but that alone is not enough, there needs to be a driving force to move forwards. Simply the desire not to be tied to the heavens and earth is not enough to move. There needs to be some goal, hope, or idea. If you wish to be a bird, if you need to save a sister, if you must reach the pomegranate hanging above the silent stream. 

In the Shallow-Depths of Air one may be free, but if you lose the spirit you quickly find that the depths may drown and the skies may melt your wax wings.
