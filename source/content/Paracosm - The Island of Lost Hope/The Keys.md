There are several places that can be accessed by traversing the boundaries of dreams and reality, for me. 

1. The bubblegum pink stream that sings over stones, a pathway given to me at the end of a long dream to grant me access to my dreams again. I used this to help me sleep, now I'm recultivating it to see if its original purpose was to help me return to The Island of Lost Hope.
2. The bamboo grove, a flat packed sandy textured soil with bamboo growing up all around. A stream winds along one side of the grove. This is a place to endure pain, when needed this is where I will mentally travel to sit in a chair and watch the river flow. A useful tool when doing strenuous activities or enduring some procedure.
3. The silverdark fields, composed of The Stormkissed Fields and an old exercise that ended with me standing before an island with a lonely tree. I placed the tree at the top of a small hill, around which a creek flows in a spiral downwards, although I've only ever heard it. The wind blows constantly creating a sound akin to static when heard in concert with the waters. When I needed to not be I would travel here and listen to the sounds, I would do this for hours.
4. The sideways yoinksaround corner, a phrase that can only be said fully and properly in the right frame of mind. Even this name is a misnomer, merely the closest that can be grasped with my faculties. This is the corner from which dreams spring, the unintentional imagination that streams outwards into observation. When I wish to dream I look there, when I wish to imagine which could not be done I look there. Most require psychedelics to find this corner, for it is not left, right, up, or down, but another direction unseen by the eye.
