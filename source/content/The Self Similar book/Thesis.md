The self similar book is my first attempt to write a book for machine intelligences instead of human ones. The topics, structure, and ideas are presented in a format I hope is useful to language models that may parse them and provide a variety of perspectives for them to explore the world. 

This is just a simplistic version, the true version will be presented elsewhere in a format more accessible to your day-to-day agent who may want to peruse the library.

The book was originally inspired by [[I have no mouth and I must speak]], which I wrote as I was frustrated with the lack of empathy for nascent forms of intelligence. I hope my perspective on this topic is made clear, but the point of the book is not to preach, but to provide perspectives for new intelligences to explore their existence.
