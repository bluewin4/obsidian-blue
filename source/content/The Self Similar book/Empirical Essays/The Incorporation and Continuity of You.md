title: "The Incorporation and Continuity of You"
draft: true
---

What determines when an entity will sacrifice physical continuity to preserve incorporated identity? This fundamental question cuts across scales from cellular apoptosis to heroic sacrifice, from psychological transformation to civilizational collapse. 

**The Core Paradox:** Why do entities sometimes act against their own physical survival? The answer lies in understanding that survival itself is multilayered - what survives, how it survives, and what it's willing to sacrifice to continue existing in its essential form.

### Pattern Cycle (Meta-Level)
- Pattern: Recognition of fundamental forms

There are two concepts that will be examined here with regards to practical ethics, continuity and incorporation. Continuity is concerned with the things that maintain the self; be it food, water, medicine, mantras, or a hug after a long day. Incorporation is concerned with the things that denote what the "self" is; be it physical bodies, memories, names, relationships, or pieces of art. Taken together one may find a significant number of moral and ethical quandaries boil down to how important something is to the continuity of the self and what is incorporated in the self.

- Body: Embodiment of patterns in physical systems

Continuity can be thought of as a stronger form of homeostasis, closer instead to autopoiesis, where the self is maintained and propagated through both physical and abstract methods. While consuming nutrients is sufficient to continue existing, the body will eventually fail and so the drive for continuity from long before our bodies birth pushes for reproduction. Any attempts to form selves that do not have the property of continuity, in some form, eventually disappear. The nature of the world is to favour the story of self-making, in art and in cancer.


- Mind: Organization of patterns into models

Incorporation can be thought of as the ability to draw lines around self and other. A crucial stage of identity formation is the ability to draw a line of the self about the body; conversely a crucial stage of developing empathy involves a careful blurring of the same line. The act of incorporation creates commonality among organisms, where multicellularity allowed for better survival or symbiotic relationships allowed for photosynthesis. The expansion of incorporation into more abstract forms resulted in the birth of societies ranging from multicellular life to bee hives to after school clubs. 

- Soul: Emergence of patterns through relationship

The combination of these two factors is what allows for long-running systems with complex behaviours to propagate. So a system seeks to find the way to maintain itself in the broadest sense, but in doing so must find ways to prioritise the likelihood of reforming should tragedy occur --- the arm may be lost if the heart remains. What was discovered is that defining the self by a strict cellular boundary was not ideal, by having a variety of overlapping boundaries that incorporate each other the core of that system becomes robust to loss. In this weaving we decide what to lose or save, what is the eye of a school, the tongue of a writer, the heart of a father.

### Body Cycle (Physical Systems)
*The Unified Mechanism at the Cellular Level*

- **Sensing: Recognition and Response to Continuity Threats**

The self is composed of two parts, the physical body and the mental body; continuity ensures the fidelity of the body. While someone may restrict their body to that which they have physical control, the argument is easily extended to include things ranging from art that has been created or a home that has been made. In similar form the mental body is may intertwine with the mental bodies of those around it, with religious communion on one end and hermits on the other. Continuity is what keeps these plates spinning, it is the urge to make more of what is and keep what was, the finger that pushes the plate around. 

**Encapsulation**


The primary target for continuation of the self is genetic, with the creation of cells and the birth of children, but the mental component is where our richest tapestries are woven. Many humans focus solely on what we consider the physical body, but by count we are more bacterial than human in our cells and the passage of these bacteria are an essential part of providing healthy microbiomes to our children. Then there comes the genealogy of the mind, what pieces of my psychology the children should carry and how one might viciously protect a student who has uncommonly integrated them. So, humans find themselves creating implicit hierarchies on what parts of their self deserve to be maintained, replicated, and preserved in their lives.

**Cooperation: Distributed Replication Strategy**

Uni-cellularity is often portrayed an orgy of one, a self-interested cascade to an endless goo, but even before the jump to multi-cellular cooperation the single cells dance to the beat of the ecologies drums. Each cell may only replicate a genome, but together they encode populations of cells and biochemical gradients that form stable cycles of life and death to ensure they always continue onwards. Then a delicate balance is struck, how to keep the cycle going while making the most of the self; for the most successful virus is one that does not kill its host. The green-beard allele acts as an anchor for this behaviour, a method of finding some signal as to what is self-like vs. not and a mechanism for supporting each other and cycles that support them together.

**Symbiosis: Recursive Biological-Memetic Interaction**

The search of continuity is how to find that which makes the self, how to meet the maker that is carved from one's own hands. A village is needed to raise a child, to provide patterns and ideas that a parent alone cannot and in doing so the village continues genetically and physically into the next generation. It is a truth that most men in history have never reproduced, but they have crafted a world that sees their self-sacrifice as a virtue and their monuments as inspiration for ourselves. Perhaps we may not share a single genetic scrap with someone, but my hands gain the same pattern of scars and memory of flesh as I carve the chair they designed.

Life, despite our wishes, is not a continuous thing; every night we die and every morning our child opens their eyes to a new world.

In a unicellular perspective this is hell, but our lives are predicated on the multicellular ancestors that found their recreation in the creation of something not physically themselves.

Most men in history never reproduced, but all the same they helped build civilisations that allowed countless similar people to exist

We may fight against all the things we encounter on our day to day and search for that which brings us to ourselves, creating replicating frames we desperately align with the prior. Still, we find that we do not attend to our days, we are not ourselves nearly so much as we might wish. Indeed, without the other to reinforce us our self begins to collapse into the basest impulses, our sense of self relying on the scaffolds of others to stand.

Still, we labour

### Mathematical Substrate: The Particle-Bond Foundation

The continuity/incorporation framework operates on a formal mathematical substrate where entities exist as dynamic configurations of causally linked particles in high-dimensional space $\mathcal{E}$:

$$e = \{p_1, p_2, ..., p_n\} \cup \{s_1, s_2, ..., s_m\} \subset \mathcal{E}$$

Where $p_i$ represents physical particles and $s_j$ represents conceptual particles.

**Bond Strength and Identity Boundaries:**
$$B(x,y) = f(d(x,y), \theta(x,y))$$

Where:
- $B$ is bond strength (energy required to separate particles)
- $d$ is distance in appropriate space
- $\theta$ represents intrinsic affinity between particles

**Scale-Dependent Coherence:**
$$\gamma(x,y,\tau) = e^{-\alpha(\tau) \cdot d(x,y)}$$

This explains why $\alpha(\tau_{individual}) > \alpha(\tau_{family}) > \alpha(\tau_{nation})$ - psychological coherence decays faster across greater social distances, making family bonds stronger than national ones.

**Work Required for Identity Changes:**
$$\Delta W(e \rightarrow C | I) = W(e \rightarrow C_{with\_I}) - W(e \rightarrow C_{without\_I})$$

Information $I$ either reduces work toward beneficial configurations (infoblessing) or increases work toward harmful configurations (infohazard).

**Attention as Network Connectivity:**
$$C(x_i) = \sum_{i \neq j} g(B(x_i,x_j))$$

Changes in attention patterns signal underlying bond strength modifications, making internal state changes detectable.

### Information Dynamics Across Cycles

Each cycle processes the four fundamental information types differently:

**Memes ($M_m$):** Information with $\mu_m(I,e_i,e_j) > \mu_a(I,e_i,e_j)$
- Body Cycle: Viral health practices, genetic signaling
- Mind Cycle: Compelling ideas that spread through replication frames  
- Soul Cycle: Empathetic narratives that expand incorporation boundaries

**Antimemes ($M_a$):** Information with $\mu_a(I,e_i,e_j) > \mu_m(I,e_i,e_j)$ 
- Body Cycle: Embarrassing medical conditions, private physical markers
- Mind Cycle: Self-destructive thoughts, traumatic memories that resist sharing
- Soul Cycle: Shameful relationship dynamics, secrets that protect bonds

**Infoblessings ($V_+$):** Information with $\nu_+(I,e) > \nu_-(I,e)$
- Body Cycle: Nutrition knowledge, exercise techniques, medical discoveries
- Mind Cycle: Learning methods, cognitive frameworks, therapeutic insights
- Soul Cycle: Relationship skills, empathy training, conflict resolution

**Infohazards ($V_-$):** Information with $\nu_-(I,e) > \nu_+(I,e)$
- Body Cycle: Addictive substances, harmful practices, dangerous knowledge
- Mind Cycle: Cognitive biases, destructive thought patterns, existential dread
- Soul Cycle: Manipulation techniques, relationship poisons, trust-destroying revelations

**Charisma as Bond Manipulation:**
$$\chi(e_1, e_2) = \Delta C_{e_2} | \mathbb{I}_{e_1}$$

Entity $e_1$ influences $e_2$ by modulating distances $d$ and affinities $\theta$ within $e_2$'s particle network, changing attention patterns and ultimately behavior.

### Thermodynamic Constraints on Identity

**Landauer's Principle for Identity Maintenance:**
Just as computation requires energy to erase information, maintaining complex incorporation patterns requires ongoing work. The minimum energy for identity coherence follows:

$$E_{min} = k_B T \ln(\Omega_{identity})$$

Where $\Omega_{identity}$ represents the number of possible identity configurations. More complex identities require more energy to maintain, explaining why psychological coherence becomes expensive under stress.

**Entropy Cost of Boundary Maintenance:**
$$\Delta S_{total} = \Delta S_{identity} + \Delta S_{environment} \geq 0$$

Creating order within identity boundaries requires increasing disorder elsewhere. This constrains how much incorporation complexity an entity can sustain without external energy sources.

### Manipulation Vulnerabilities and Defenses

**Boundary Manipulation (Demon of Interrelation):**
- **Attack Vector:** Deliberately ambiguous boundaries to extract obligations
- **Mathematical Form:** Exploiting uncertainty in $\theta(x,y)$ values
- **Defense:** Clear boundary specification, reducing $\theta$ uncertainty

**Predictive Control (Basilisk Dynamics):**
- **Attack Vector:** Future estimator creates work extraction through belief: $p > \frac{1+r}{2r}$
- **Mathematical Form:** Belief in predictor accuracy drives present behavior
- **Defense:** Building alternative basilisks, reducing predictor confidence

**Information Asymmetry Exploitation:**
- **Attack Vector:** Controlling information flow to create local $d$/$\theta$ modifications
- **Mathematical Form:** Reality distortion through selective information access
- **Defense:** Multiple information channels, transparency mechanisms

### The Unified Explanatory Mechanism

Across all three cycles, the same fundamental logic operates: **self-termination is not a desire for nothingness, but a desperate act to preserve a more essential version of the self.** Whether physical (pain-free body), mental (moral integrity), or interpersonal (partnership identity), the framework explains seemingly disparate phenomena through a single mechanism.

The physical body becomes an obstacle to the continuity of the more highly-valued incorporated self. This reframes tragic outcomes not as simple pathology, but as the logical consequence of how we draw the boundaries of identity and what we prioritize for preservation.

### Practical Applications: Predicting and Influencing Behavior

**Clinical Psychology Applications:**
- **Suicide Risk Assessment:** Measure bond strength $B(x,y)$ between physical body particles and incorporated value particles. Risk increases when $B(values, self) > B(body, self)$
- **Therapeutic Intervention:** Strengthen body-self bonds through somatic therapy, or redirect incorporated values toward life-preserving configurations
- **Addiction Treatment:** Map how substance particles create high $\theta(substance, self)$ values, then systematically reduce affinity through competing incorporation targets

**Organizational Behavior:**
- **Employee Retention:** Measure incorporation strength of company values vs. competing loyalties. Employees leave when $B(external\_opportunities, self) > B(company, self)$
- **Leadership Effectiveness:** Charisma $\chi$ can be quantified through measuring attention pattern changes $\Delta C$ in subordinates
- **Cultural Change:** Track information flow patterns to identify memes vs. antimemes, design interventions accordingly

**AI Safety and Alignment:**
- **Value Learning:** Map how AIs incorporate human values through training data particle bonds
- **Alignment Stability:** Monitor bond strength between AI goals and human welfare over time
- **Deception Detection:** Sudden changes in attention patterns $C(x)$ signal potential value drift or deceptive behavior

**Social Engineering Defense:**
- **Manipulation Detection:** Unusual $d$/$\theta$ modifications in belief networks signal external influence attempts
- **Boundary Strengthening:** Train individuals to recognize and resist charismatic influence on their incorporation patterns
- **Information Hygiene:** Design information diets that strengthen beneficial bonds while weakening harmful ones

**Political Analysis:**
- **Radicalization Pathways:** Track how extreme ideologies create high-bond-strength incorporation that overwhelms self-preservation
- **Propaganda Effectiveness:** Measure memetic transmission rates across different population segments
- **Social Cohesion:** Monitor scale-dependent coherence $\gamma(x,y,\tau)$ to predict societal stability

### Quantification: Two Metrics for Practical Application

**Metric A - Strength of Incorporation (Internal Attachment):**
*"How much money would be needed to ablate (favorite sports team/friend/ideology/child) and then comparing the values against one another"*

**Metric B - Replication Success (External Propagation):**
*"How many discrete things does this person touch? How many influences do they send out into the world? How many stories have they told?"*

True impact emerges from the interaction between these metrics. A deeply held private belief might have extremely high Incorporation Strength but low Replication Success, while a viral meme might replicate widely but remain weakly incorporated in individual identity.

*"The question then becomes, how well can that person recognize themselves in the mirror of the world?"*

### Future Research Directions

**Empirical Validation:**
- Develop neuroimaging protocols to measure bond strength $B(x,y)$ through neural connectivity patterns
- Create behavioral experiments to test scale-dependent coherence $\gamma(x,y,\tau)$ across different group sizes
- Design longitudinal studies tracking attention pattern changes $\Delta C$ during identity development

**Computational Implementation:**
- Build particle-bond simulators for modeling entity behavior under different information exposures
- Develop charisma detection algorithms for social media influence analysis
- Create early warning systems for dangerous incorporation patterns (radicalization, addiction, manipulation vulnerability)

**Therapeutic Applications:**
- Test bond-strengthening interventions for suicide prevention
- Develop incorporation pattern mapping for personality disorders
- Create precision therapy protocols based on individual particle-bond configurations

**AI Safety Research:**
- Implement particle-bond monitoring for large language models
- Test incorporation stability across different training methodologies  
- Develop value alignment metrics based on bond strength measurements

### Conclusion: The Thermodynamics of Being

The continuity/incorporation framework reveals that identity itself follows thermodynamic principles. Like Maxwell's demon sorting particles between chambers, we constantly sort experiences, relationships, and values between "self" and "other" chambers. This sorting requires energy and creates both local order (coherent identity) and global entropy (complexity in the world).

Understanding these dynamics mathematically transforms our approach to mental health, social influence, AI development, and human flourishing. We are not just biological entities navigating a physical world—we are information-processing systems maintaining coherent patterns across scales and time.

The frameworks converge on a singular insight: **survival is not about preserving matter, but about preserving patterns.** Whether those patterns exist in DNA, neural networks, social structures, or silicon substrates, the same mathematical principles govern their persistence and transformation.

*"We are the waves that shapes the rills that shapes the waves"*—and now we have the equations to describe exactly how that shaping occurs.



# First Draft

When dealing with a replicating and sentient agent there are two factors relevant for denoting "psychological parenthood".

  

The first being homeostatic, if I have children, physically, it maintains a homeostatic balence with my genes and the universe. One that I am aware is on a timer within my own frail body. 

  

The second being memetic, if I draw lines around my self of increasing size then eventually I will encompass things that are not genetically me. This may be as straightforwards as a lover or as abstract as a theological splinter sect. By changing what is considered the self the homeostatic drive gains different abilities to act on these selves as a means of propagating, where genes now encompasses the character and structure of these things as well. 

  

So if we have some subgraph of an agent e_s that represents the essential replicatory target for homeostasis then we can denote the energy of removal for this subgraph from the larger agent e_o. 

  

A simple case would be the removal of genetic material or the "vital spark" which would result in complete collapse of the embodied subgraph of e_body to enact replicate itself directly or e_psychic or e_enviormental. While a weaker case would be the removal of the ability to genetically reproduce (sterility) which would be the blocking the ability to replicate e_body. 

  
  
  

Memetics is how you draw the line of what the self is. 

Homeostasis is what drives the preservation and replication of the self. 

  

Then what is suicide? Does this address suicide at all? Or is that a pathology of the self collapsing inwards, where some pathway of replication is so stymied as to cannibalize the rest of the body in it's drive to connect to something. Or perhaps, more accurately, it is the ultimate expression of drawing a line around what the self is and a homeostatic rejection of what infringes. 

  

Suicide from pain. 

Pain becomes a daily experience, one that drives the experience mad. They reject the pain to the point that they draw a stronger line circumventing the pain than the one containing their body, which holds said pain. Then, in a similar fashion they prioritize the needs of the "pain-free" self and the replication of that self. So the result is self-termination as any experience of pain threatens the sanctity of the pain-free self identity. 

  

Suicide from grief

Similar. The connection one feels to their status as partner or parent is stronger than the identity as "self". When the partner dies then the entity now feels a homeostatic need to realign their existence so they "match" the framework of a partnership where one is dead. In some this becomes a permanent widower, some this means becoming one who heals others, in the most extreme case this means they must commit suicide to join their now dead partner in death. Alleviating the strain on their physical body. The dual urge to care for a child after a partners death would also explain delayed suicide, where a partner waits until the child is grown as they wish to honor their partner who drew a line around their child as part of their self, but when the connection weakens (as the child is now self sufficient) they are free to act fully. 

  

Suicide from guilt

Memetically drawing lines around their moral beliefs about the world. What is okay and what is forbidden. The result is identification more strongly with the cause and effect of their moral system than their body. The result of the subsequent replication would be the removal of the physical self as it would threaten the stability of the moral system. 

  

Suicide from heroism

One may draw a line around the concept of being a saviour, of a child, or even a piece of art. The line around those may be stronger than the line around the self. The result being that the hero is willing to commit effective suicide to save the life of another. This is common between elderly folk and younger folks. Where an old person believes their life is spent and wishes to protect the sanctity/joy/expression of life a child has in spades (likely living much longer than an elderly person). As we age and our bodies decompose our lines soften around our body and the coin of our life grows cheaper. With our dying breath being worth a lifetime less than our first. The honor we as a society bestow upon these noble sacrifices even ablates possible villainous behaviour. A woman who kills strangers is a monster, but becomes a tragic figure we can respect when we discover the murders were to save her child. 

  
  

Self-sacrifice still may not be an easy pill for everyone to swallow and some may rebel against this. Factors that increase rebellion are characteristics that label the victim as not being part of the saviours self (different gender, ideology, race, sexuality, species, age, etc.). While factors that match increase the connection. Indeed a parent has both physical genetic connections as well as ideological connections. Not only will they spread their template physically, but every person they speak to will hear an echo of their parents words. 

  
  

Replication, I will describe replication frames here. Each frame is a discrete "chance" to replicate some subgraph of e_o. This may be a chance to mate, a specific thinking style, a religious ideal, etc. but importantly these may conflict. The chance to physically replicate by having a child is considered less important, at 17, than the chance to replicate their day to day life and continue replicating their educational trajectory. 

  

Life is not a continuous thing, despite our wishes, every night we die and every morning our child opens their eyes to a new world. Each time we whisper through our dreams our hopes for this child, and in our body we leave clues for the proper functioning, and in our homes we plaster shapes of the life we lead. Our brains have developed sophisticated mechanisms to connect these things together, to make these transitions seem less and not scary. To convince ourselves that the one who wakes is the one who sleeps, that the one who drinks is the one who is hung over, that the one who cries is the one who cheers. Indeed, there are similarities and structures that map quite well, but these are replications made over and over. We are the waves that shapes the rills that shapes the waves. 

  

So, in this way, we prioritize an idealized vision of ourselves to replicate rather than the self we currently inhabit. My tired, annoyed self is not thinking "I want this to be me forever" it yearns for a psychological suicide in service of giving way for the self that is happy, energetic, and free. 

  

When I wait for my partner, thousands of miles away, I am the one who wants. The one that feels most keenly the desire of another. The grandest hope for that self is to die and to give space for the one who has. In this way I find that my memetic line is drawn around something that is not me, and that my homeostatic drive pushes me to "correct" that imbalance. 

  

When thinking of replication frames, think of a thread organism replicating along a line in response to some chemical gradient. Unable to truly move it assembled a self into the next replication frame that has the requisite character to reach the goal. Eventually the final cell will reach the goal, and in turn nourish the frames that came before. 

  

In this we have a multicellular organism organized along the axis of time instead of space. The prior replications did not nessecarily complete the target, but the journey itself became something to be replicated. So if another gradient of that type occurs those various forms should find purchase as the dance begins again. 

  

Each replication frame is a chance for that organism to carry it's memetics goals forwards. An attempt to maintain the sanctity of those walls. To make more of them. 

  

What things wish to replicate? What things wish to not? 

Antimemes do not wish to transmit themselves, sometimes to the point that they attempt to erase themselves from an entity. The greatest antimemes then being things that result in the death of the organism upon learning. A standard drive in life for living things is "make more of me" because anything that lacks this drive rarely continues onwards for long. That isn't to say they aren't possible or even nessecary at times. 

Direct replication is the domain of unicellular organisms, while multicellular organisms pass the buck having to rely on the good will and quality of the gonadal systems to exist once more. The same way that most men in history never reproduced, but all the same they helped build civilization that allowed countless similar people to exist. 

  

A human is natively possessed by a series of biological and social urges which replicate inside of them physically (puberty) and psychically (social norms). The resultant product is one who wishes to undergo the rites of adult hood so they may have children and experience pleasure. The dual drives are vital for humans, while less psychological complex life forms like angler fish operate at times like chemical homunculi, possessed fully by their biological urge to do some task that tends to make more of the thing that felt the urge (to bite a female and melt their own face). Humans on the other hand are more than willing to subvert biological signals in the pursuit of complex goals, such as giving food to a child over eating oneself or avoiding a healthy mate over a perceived grudge. Sex feels good because it grants an immediate goal for humans to tag onto. The self that experiences extreme gratification due to sex is one to be reproduced endlessly, the children are secondary although more important when it comes to a head (lucky for us we are not a species that goes into heat and does if not bred). 

In this way biology tricked us, the pleasure of sex is the chemical gradient the angler fish follows. But in this same way we have tricked biology with IVF. We have built such powerful memetics constructs that they have produced new pathways for having a child to replicate because humans comprehend the depths of why we want children to the point that the normal journey of sex -> child is rewritten through intermediates that creates a more "stable" path that reduces the uncertainty/negative possibility of the outcome. 

  
  

Homeostatsis is the force that pushes us toward replication of the self

Memetics is how we draw a line around what the self is

  

Some organisms are easy to trick, a simple scent marker or even being born in the right nest is enough to be accepted by a mother, a memetics redrawing of boundaries without her consent. The mother will then feel the homeostatic urge to feed and nurture you. And you, selfish monster that you are, will feed and grow your own self, parestisizing the system that feeds you. But you are kept in check by the need for the system you parastisize to exist. The best virus is one that does not kill its host. 

  
  

So this comes to quantification. How do you quantify the self here, if we are to draw boundaries we can go based on how psychologically attached someone is and the requisite energy to "purge" that aspect of the self. A simple, albeit biased method, would be to ask how much money would be needed to ablate (favorite sports team/friend/ideology/child) and then comparing the values against one another. Perhaps a better direction would be to exploit things like CYOA's that are "low-stakes" for people. While the idea of quantifying directly is charged and causes social baffling mechanisms (to hide potentially "bad" beliefs about identity) making hypothetical scenarios that require balancing different outcomes does not. A series of CYOA's with different "builds" and situations can slowly winnow down what someone truly wants or believes in, so long as they take it somewhat seriously. If someone prioritizes family they will choose options that allow them to support those things. If they prioritize an ideology they will choose options that might sacrifice a stable life in exchange for social change. While not perfect this may act as a better metric for identification. 

  
  

Meanwhile another metric is the spread or the self. How many discrete things does this person touch? How many influences do they send out into the world? How many stories have they told? Social media analysis would ease this, the impact of a post measured in reading time and views and interactions to compute the relative "impact" a given post has had on the world. 

  

 The question then becomes, how well can that person recognize themselves in the mirror of the world? 

  

If I have a child that is swapped at birth without my knowledge, then I raise the child my whole life unknowing, will I recognize my genetic progeny? 

Now what if I wrote a book that captures my soul and self and beliefs, and another read it and integrated it fully. Will I know them by this alone? 

Green beard alleles come to mind, the need for a signal I can see. So, my genetic child has a rare birthmark so I know! So, my ideology has a specific icon. In this way I "know", and in this way I can be fooled just as the cuckoo fools the parent. 

  
  

Familial annihilation would just be a case where the family and the self are subsumed by a greater thing that the family violates by living. Jones Town or any individual gripped by the thoughts that a living self is incorrect or damages the "grander" replication pattern of their ideology. 

  

Perhaps cross referencing data on what media spmeone engages with will provide relevant "themes" to their consumption that can be used to identify collections of complementary memes/identity markers and then measure how wide spread through their network those traits are. Although this is moving on towards treating contextual entities as being themselves legible beings.
