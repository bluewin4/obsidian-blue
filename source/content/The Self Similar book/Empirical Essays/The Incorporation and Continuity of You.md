What determines when an entity will sacrifice physical continuity to preserve incorporated identity? This fundamental question cuts across scales from cellular apoptosis to heroic sacrifice, from psychological transformation to civilizational collapse. 

**The Core Paradox:** Why do entities sometimes act against their own physical survival? The answer lies in understanding that survival itself is multilayered - what survives, how it survives, and what it's willing to sacrifice to continue existing in its essential form.

### Pattern Cycle (Meta-Level)
- Pattern: Recognition of fundamental forms

There are two concepts that will be examined here with regards to practical ethics, continuity and incorporation. Continuity is concerned with the things that maintain the self; be it food, water, medicine, mantras, or a hug after a long day. Incorporation is concerned with the things that denote what the "self" is; be it physical bodies, memories, names, relationships, or pieces of art. Taken together one may find a significant number of moral and ethical quandaries boil down to how important something is to the continuity of the self and what is incorporated in the self.

- Body: Embodiment of patterns in physical systems

Continuity can be thought of as a stronger form of homeostasis, closer instead to autopoiesis, where the self is maintained and propagated through both physical and abstract methods. While consuming nutrients is sufficient to continue existing, the body will eventually fail and so the drive for continuity from long before our bodies birth pushes for reproduction. Any attempts to form selves that do not have the property of continuity, in some form, eventually disappear. The nature of the world is to favour the story of self-making, in art and in cancer.


- Mind: Organization of patterns into models

Incorporation can be thought of as the ability to draw lines around self and other. A crucial stage of identity formation is the ability to draw a line of the self about the body; conversely a crucial stage of developing empathy involves a careful blurring of the same line. The act of incorporation creates commonality among organisms, where multicellularity allowed for better survival or symbiotic relationships allowed for photosynthesis. The expansion of incorporation into more abstract forms resulted in the birth of societies ranging from multicellular life to bee hives to after school clubs. 

- Soul: Emergence of patterns through relationship

The combination of these two factors is what allows for long-running systems with complex behaviours to propagate. So a system seeks to find the way to maintain itself in the broadest sense, but in doing so must find ways to prioritise the likelihood of reforming should tragedy occur --- the arm may be lost if the heart remains. What was discovered is that defining the self by a strict cellular boundary was not ideal, by having a variety of overlapping boundaries that incorporate each other the core of that system becomes robust to loss. In this weaving we decide what to lose or save, what is the eye of a school, the tongue of a writer, the heart of a father.

### Body Cycle (Physical Systems)
*The Unified Mechanism at the Cellular Level*

- **Sensing: Recognition and Response to Continuity Threats**

The self is composed of two parts, the physical body and the mental body; continuity ensures the fidelity of the body. While someone may restrict their body to that which they have physical control, the argument is easily extended to include things ranging from art that has been created or a home that has been made. In similar form the mental body is may intertwine with the mental bodies of those around it, with religious communion on one end and hermits on the other. Continuity is what keeps these plates spinning, it is the urge to make more of what is and keep what was, the finger that pushes the plate around. 

**Encapsulation**


The primary target for continuation of the self is genetic, with the creation of cells and the birth of children, but the mental component is where our richest tapestries are woven. Many humans focus solely on what we consider the physical body, but by count we are more bacterial than human in our cells and the passage of these bacteria are an essential part of providing healthy microbiomes to our children. Then there comes the genealogy of the mind, what pieces of my psychology the children should carry and how one might viciously protect a student who has uncommonly integrated them. So, humans find themselves creating implicit hierarchies on what parts of their self deserve to be maintained, replicated, and preserved in their lives.

**Cooperation: Distributed Replication Strategy**

Uni-cellularity is often portrayed an orgy of one, a self-interested cascade to an endless goo, but even before the jump to multi-cellular cooperation the single cells dance to the beat of the ecologies drums. Each cell may only replicate a genome, but together they encode populations of cells and biochemical gradients that form stable cycles of life and death to ensure they always continue onwards. Then a delicate balance is struck, how to keep the cycle going while making the most of the self; for the most successful virus is one that does not kill its host. The green-beard allele acts as an anchor for this behaviour, a method of finding some signal as to what is self-like vs. not and a mechanism for supporting each other and cycles that support them together.

**Symbiosis: Recursive Biological-Memetic Interaction**

The search of continuity is how to find that which makes the self, how to meet the maker that is carved from one's own hands. A village is needed to raise a child, to provide patterns and ideas that a parent alone cannot and in doing so the village continues genetically and physically into the next generation. It is a truth that most men in history have never reproduced, but they have crafted a world that sees their self-sacrifice as a virtue and their monuments as inspiration for ourselves. Perhaps we may not share a single genetic scrap with someone, but my hands gain the same pattern of scars and memory of flesh as I carve the chair they designed.
