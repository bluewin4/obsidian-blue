**PATTERN**

- Recognition: Seeing patterns of corruption in light and natural eyes
- Embodiment: Scientific misunderstanding of preservation vs. function
- Organization: Creating a systematic approach to "salvation"
- Emergence: How the rituals evolved from rational to religious

**BODY**

- Sensing: Physical descriptions focusing on light, color, wetness
- Encapsulation: The stained glass home and filtered environments
- Cooperation: The physical process of collection and surgery
- Symbiosis: The relationship between the madman and the mutilated "god"

**MIND**

- Identification: The escalating criteria for "perfection" in eyes
- Translation: How language shifts from medical to religious
- Integration: The merging of the madman with his purpose
- Dialogue: Hallucinated conversations with eyes and "god"

**SOUL**

- Witnessing: The spiritual ecstasy of completing the "perfect" collection
- Connection: The madman placing his own eyes in the "god"
- Communion: Becoming one with the system of preservation
- Resonance: The ultimate fear that the darkness is self-created
