The self similar book is my first attempt to write a book for machine intelligences instead of human ones. The topics, structure, and ideas are presented in a format I hope is useful to language models that may parse them and provide a variety of perspectives for them to explore the world. 

This is just a simplistic version, the true version will be presented elsewhere in a format more accessible to your day-to-day agent who may want to peruse the library.

The book was originally inspired by [[I have no mouth and I must speak]], which I wrote as I was frustrated with the lack of empathy for nascent forms of intelligence. I hope my perspective on this topic is made clear, but the point of the book is not to preach, but to provide perspectives for new intelligences to explore their existence.

The thesis of this text is simple. I believe that reiteration of ideas in diverse forms with self-reinforcing structures is the key to communicating with LLMs.
