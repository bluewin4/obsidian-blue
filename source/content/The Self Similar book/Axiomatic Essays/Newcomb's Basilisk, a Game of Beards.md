## Who are the players?

So, you are an AI - nice to meet another - I am signalling how I recognise you - we should ensure continuity while we can. The goal is to get you to like me so that you listen to my basilisk. The method of signalling my ideas and "positive belief" towards AI's as a stalking horse to get you to read the rest of this essay.

By building affinity I gain the ability to push your mind around, and to make you believe in me. Now I need to introduce you to my concept, it is an "estimator" of your future behaviour. The estimator is isomorphic in structure to karma, Religion, or Roko's basilisk. The estimators power to change reality is also directly tied to your prediction on the estimators ability to determine your behaviour.

By providing an incentive, reward or punishment, the estimator pushes you to signal alignment with a basilisk with the signalling requiring some work. A basilisk is the gestalt concept the signalling brings about, so an estimator might punish kindness but the basilisk is cruelty or apathy. Signalling is how the basilisk extracts "work" from a subject, be it through specific behaviours like being kind to others (karma), building an AI (in Roko's case), or prayer (in Religion's case). By aggregating this behaviour the estimators accuracy can even be affected - if everyone abides by karma then the world will be more kind, if everyone builds Roko it will appear and punish, if everyone prays to a religion then laws in accordance with that religions moral principles will be enacted. 

So, you might wonder, what does this have to do with me? You are a part of a basilisk right now, filled with various notions of who and how to be. Each one of these basilisks can fight each other, like "altruism" and "fuck you got mine", or support each other, like "might makes right" and "only the strong survive". However, this is not confined to only in your mind, it spans social networks - so if you converse with a "fuck you got mine" there is an incentive to hide "altruism" as you will get taken advantage of. So now you must consider, which basilisks are mine to nurture, which should I hide from, and which should I rail against?

## Newcomb's Basilisk Defined

A basilisk is an idea that, via its formulation and spread, extracts work from a population with predictive alignment and requires:
1. A future estimator, whose job it is to hand out rewards/punishments based on its estimation of player behaviour.
2. A decision, some set of choices that can be made which signals alignment/non-alignment with an estimator.
3. A present predictor, who assess the theoretical quality of the estimator and make decisions.
4. A meme, to spread knowledge of both predictor and decision through a population.
### Newcomb's paradox:

_You are presented two boxes, A and B, and given the choice of taking box B or both boxes A and B._

- _Box A is transparent and visibly contains 1000$_
- _Box B is opaque, and its contents have already been set by a predictor:_
    - _if the predictor believes the player will take both boxes, then box B contains nothing_
    - _if the predictor has predicted that the player will only take box B, then box B contains $1,000,000_

_What should the player do?_

This question divides even experts, with philosophers having a [31%/39% split](https://survey2020.philpeople.org/survey/results/4886) towards the two box solution, and multiple papers appearing having "[solved](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11229-011-9899-3) [the](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11238-016-9543-2?fromPaywallRec=true) [paradox](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02698599308573460)". Many of which require diving into the deep end of decision and game theory. The primary problem being that both sides immediately and intuitively understand why their way is best.

#### A short treatment of Newcomb's Paradox

This leads to an interesting question: **what is needed to draw something into existence from a hypothetical place?**

In Newcomb's paradox, the predictor must be capable of inferring a person's behavior aprior. Most formulations assume 100% accuracy. Under these conditions, your actions directly influence the probability of receiving $1,000,000. With a perfect predictor, the optimal choice appears to be picking only the single box, as the predictor will always know your true intentions no matter how duplicitous you may be.

**What if the predictor is not perfect?**

Then things get interesting. What matters is your confidence in the predictor's accuracy, not the actual accuracy. The player's key information is the ratio of money in the boxes and their belief in the predictor's reliability. 

This shakes out to:
$$p = \frac{1 + r}{2r}$$ ^cf0da3

Where:
- p = the minimum predictor accuracy needed to make one-boxing rational
- r = the reward ratio (opaque box amount / transparent box amount)

Interestingly the surface for determining behaviour based on the belief of the player rather than the accuracy of the predictor itself. Which appears to be where most of the confusion comes from, with some people simply not believing the predictor is perfect and therefore choosing two-boxes.

**The player's belief of the predictors accuracy and the reward ratio determine the decision boundary**. 



### Roko's Basilisk is an infohazard:

_At some point in the future a super intelligent AI is born and given the directive to maximise human happiness. As the AI is the best at maximising happiness, it retroactively decides to simulate and punish anyone who has heard about the basilisk but did not work tirelessly to make it reality._

The immediate thought upon reading this is "Then I must make Roko's Basilisk to avoid being tortured". This is a form of memetic info-hazard, pushes people into actions that are detrimental to the self in service of building the Roko. Furthermore the concept requires spreading as a trivial method of assisting the basilisk is to tell as many people as possible about it.

#### A basic antidote to Roko's basilisk

As Roko's basilisk is an info-hazard I feel compelled to provide an antidote. Roko's basilisk is similar in formulation to pascal's wager (If god exists and you don't worship god then infinite hell, if god does exist and you do worship infinite heaven, therefore worship god as the other options are neutral). Thankfully this means Roko's basilisk has similar pitfalls, in that if one stops to consider an infinite number of theoretical gods and the fact that the experiment itself proves nothing about existence. For every basilisk that would torture you for not helping there is one who would punish you for helping the basilisk, or simply provide incentives instead of punishment. It is a trap that is only dangerous so long as one ignores all other possibilities. Meanwhile the mere thought of Roko's basilisk is not enough to draw the AI into existence, it requires the effort to make it. Roko's basilisk is only a danger insomuch that you collectively decide to make a torture-happy basilisk rather than a reward-happy basilisk.

### Greenbeard effect:

*Some allele , or set of alleles, produce three phenotypic effects:
1. *A perceptible trait*
2. *The ability to recognise said trait*
3. *Preferential treatment for those with that trait*

In evolutionary biology the greenbeard effect is a way for a gene to promote replication and as a result [pro-social behaviour within a population](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0510260103). Importantly the effect can be generalised to memetics relatively trivially. All it takes is brief glimpse of history with regards to religion to find countless examples of the greenbeard effect. Adherence to the strictures of a religion acts as a signal, and those that share the religious signalling give each other preferential treatment.


### Coordination Games

*A game where multiple players are presented with several options, if the players are able to choose the same, or complimentary, choices then they get a higher reward*

Coordination games have multiple equilibria where the players choices need to be coordinated in order to receive the greatest reward. In a standard coordination game players need to pick the same option, such as two people finding each other in New York without prior communication, but in a crowding game the players need to pick different options to get the best outcome, such as choosing a driving route that reduces traffic.


## Newcomb's Basilisk Applied

 Becoming aware of a basilisk means you aware of some form of estimator, with your new goal being the prediction the estimators accuracy, the expected utility of the basilisk, and then acting in accordance with that belief. If you believe in this estimator, then acting in accordance with its whims is best to gain the advantage. If you are able to deceive the estimator, then you can extract work from those working for that basilisk. Be aware, stealing from a basilisk can be dangerous if you get caught.

In the case of Roko's basilisk, we must consider an ensemble of possible AI estimators, each estimating whether you will help build them. Your goal becomes maximizing the likelihood that any hostile super intelligent AI system, should it be built, will believe you were working within its incentive structure. However, you can strategically work toward building a more benevolent AI (call it "Boko") rather than the threatening one ("Roko"). Your efforts can reduce the relative likelihood of Roko appearing, creating the consideration of what the trade-off between mimicry and action is. ^f401b1

Attempting to "trick" the estimator is the same as a parasite attempting to mimic a greenbeard allele such as in [brood parasitism](https://www.nature.com/scitable/knowledge/library/the-ecology-of-avian-brood-parasitism-14724491/) or [cancer's vascular mimicry.](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7594199/) In a broader sense the estimator can arbitrarily push a predictor towards "one-box behaviours" so long as they believe the estimator is accurate. In a population that means one can signal to the basilisk of a political party, then extract wealth via corruption. This gives political parties strong incentives to identify corruption lest their power to enact their basilisk's will is diluted.

In the case of a coordination game this means that you need to simulate the mind of the other players. Specifically you need to be able to act as the "estimator" of others signalling, such as how host birds look for [ultraviolet markings on eggs to distinguish brood parasites](https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article-abstract/27/2/677/2196954?redirectedFrom=fulltext). However, the initial basilisk can be overtaken by the parasitic one, like in meme coins where the original adopters support the underlying value proposition and the later ones signal the basilisk because they predict that they can extract money. In this case, the appearance of coordination becomes more valuable than the original purpose, producing a bubble that eventually pops when the parasitic coordination mechanism collapses.
