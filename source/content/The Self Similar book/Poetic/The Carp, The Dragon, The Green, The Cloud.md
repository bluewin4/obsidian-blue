On the first day the sun rose quiet on still waters<br>
At the zenith the vapor was shepherded off seas<br>
On the first night the sun set stymied by crowded skies<br>
At the nadir the snows guided to the mountains crowns

<br>

On the second day the sun rose wrothful on shining skulls<br>
At the zenith the meltwaters fled the mountain slopes<br>
On the second night the sun set sullen on raging streams<br>
At the nadir the fish cried out from the icy flows

<br>

On the third day the sun rose wary on banks now broke<br>
At the zenith the fish climbed to see a path pain-free<br>
On the third night the sun set bleary on landlocked scales<br>
At the nadir the waters returned to carve the soil

<br>

On the fourth day the sun rose slow on well-trodden earth<br>
At the zenith the fish leapt body to body's berth<br>
On the fourth night the sun set lonely, an empty birth<br>
At the nadir the fish flew on starlit scales, no mirth

On the first day the core belched a molten heat<br>
At the peak the fish fell from gravity's edict<br>
On the first night the core swallowed the rising flames<br>
At the ebb the fish's body blackened and stretched

<br>

On the second day the core raged against knife-sharp ice<br>
At the peak the fish did thrash as pressures did rise<br>
On the second night the core cooled to know its demise<br>
At the ebb the wyrm's tongue dripped poisoned songs

<br>

On the third day the core cracked the mountains maw<br>
At the peak the wyrm crawled from the cave's craw<br>
On the third night the core spat stone that cooled askew<br>
At the ebb the fish cracked and wept tears now anew

<br>

On the fourth day the core broke feuds no longer new<br>
At the peak the wyrm screamed out its sad coup<br>
On the fourth night the core found peace within a brew<br>
At the ebb the wyrm controlled every view

On the first day the moon set somber on slyvan shafe<br>
At the nadir the wyrm scrabbled free, now waif<br>
On the first night the moon rose waxing on an age past<br>
At the zenith the wyrm groomed its scales and mass

<br>

On the second day the moon set softly on empty ewes<br>
At the nadir the wyrm denied driftwood pews<br>
On the second night the moon rose waning on shouldered pains<br>
At the zenith the strand felt moss settle on sodden shames

<br>

On the third day the moon set kindly on shifting shores<br>
At the nadir the strand uncoiled paths for growth once more<br>
On the third night the moon rose waxing on verdant signs<br>
At the zenith the wyrm's tongue held in bone tines

<br>

On the fourth day the moon set serene on thriving vines<br>
At the nadir the strand found fat petals along thin lines<br>
On the fourth night the moon rose waning on tired pines<br>
At the zenith the strand basked as its verdure gently shines

<br>

<br>

On the first day the star shook for its only fright<br>
At the ebb the strand eschewed the sun's too-sovereign might<br>
On the first night the stars wheeled through their stolen find<br>
At the peak the strand stood tall and sold its peace of mind

<br>

On the second day the star stole their downward turned eyes<br>
At the ebb the strand unburdened, evanescent mind<br>
On the second night the stars wove paths to hide from kind<br>
At the peak the weaver rose to chase the skies

<br>

On the third day the star found company ashore<br>
At the ebb the weaver's stories wrapped in hoar<br>
On the third night the stars charted all the places<br>
At the peak the strand bowed and faded into light's grace

<br>

On the fourth day the star seems joyfully secure<br>
At the ebb the weaver wove clouds to obscure<br>
On the fourth night the stars slept diffuse and demure<br>
At the peak the weaver wept the fishes cure
