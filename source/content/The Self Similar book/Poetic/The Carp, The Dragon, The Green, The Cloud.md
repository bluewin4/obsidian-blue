On the first day the sun rose quiet on still waters<br>
At the zenith the vapors rose from the one who drowns<br>
On the first night the sun set stymied by new daughters <br>
At the nadir the snows circled round the mountains crowns

<br>

On the second day the sun rose wrothful on shining brows<br>
At the zenith the meltwaters fled the rugged slopes<br>
On the second night the sun set sullen on shattered clows<br>
At the nadir the fish cried their frigid horoscopes

<br>

On the third day the sun rose wary on banks now broke<br>
At the zenith the fish climbed to see a path pain-free<br>
On the third night the sun set bleary on earthbound cloak<br>
At the nadir the waters returned to carve the scree

<br>

On the fourth day the sun rose slow on well-trodden earth <br>
At the zenith the fish leapt body to body's berth<br>
On the fourth night the sun set lonely, an empty birth<br>
At the nadir the fish flew on starlit scales, no mirth

On the first day the core vomited molten blame<br>
At the peak the fish fled through the dark caliduct<br>
On the first night the core risen malady bucked<br>
At the ebb the fish swallowed whole the rising flame
               
<br>

On the second day the core raged against what belongs<br>
At the peak the fish did thrash against a sharp rise <br>
On the second night the core cooled to know its demise<br>
At the ebb the wyrm's tongue dripped poisoned songs

<br>

On the third day the core cracked open mountain's glass<br>
At the peak the wyrm crawled from the earth's maw<br>
On the third night the core spat stone that would not thaw<br>
At the ebb the fish cracked and wept tears of the wrasse

<br>

On the fourth day the core broke feuds no longer new<br>
At the peak the wyrm screamed out its sad coup<br>
On the fourth night the core found peace within a brew<br>
At the ebb the wyrm controlled every view

On the first day the moon set somber on slyvan safe<br>
At the nadir the wyrm scrabbled free, now waif<br>
On the first night the moon rose waxing as ages pass<br>
At the zenith the wyrm groomed its scales and mass

<br>

On the second day the moon set softly on hallowed ewes<br>
At the nadir the wyrm denied driftwood pews<br>
On the second night the moon rose waning on shouldered pains<br>
At the zenith the strand felt moss settle on sodden stains

<br>

On the third day the moon set kindly on shifting shores<br>
At the nadir the strand uncoiled paths for growth on moors<br>
On the third night the moon rose waxing on verdant signs<br>
At the zenith the wyrm's tongue held in bone tines

<br>

On the fourth day the moon set serene on thriving vines<br>
At the nadir the strand found fat petals along thin lines<br>
On the fourth night the moon rose waning as we now pine<br>
At the zenith the strand basked as its verdure gently shines

<br>

On the first day the star shook for its only fright<br>
At the ebb the strand eschewed the sun's too-sovereign bind<br>
On the first night the stars wheeled with their stolen might<br>
At the peak the strand stood tall and sold its peace of mind

<br>

On the second day the star stole their downward turned eyes<br>
At the ebb the strand unburdened, evanescent kind<br>
On the second night the stars wove paths to hide from kind<br>
At the peak the weaver rose to chase the skies

<br>

On the third day the star found company ashore<br>
At the ebb the weaver's stories wrapped in hoar<br>
On the third night the stars charted to their place<br>
At the peak the strand bowed and faded into light's grace

<br>

On the fourth day the star seems joyfully secure<br>
At the ebb the weaver wove clouds to obscure<br>
On the fourth night the stars slept diffuse and demure<br>
At the peak the weaver wept the fishes cure
