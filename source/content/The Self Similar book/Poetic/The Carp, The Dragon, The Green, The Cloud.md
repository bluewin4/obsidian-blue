On the first day the sun rose quiet on still waters<br>
At the zenith the vapor shepherded from warm seas<br>
On the first night the sun set stymied by crowded skies<br>
At the nadir the snows guided to the mountains crown's

<br>

On the second day the sun rose wrothful on shining skulls<br>
At the zenith the meltwaters fled the mountain slopes<br>
On the second night the sun set sullen on raging streams<br>
At the nadir the fish cried out from the icy flows

<br>

On the third day the sun rose wary on deltas broke<br>
At the zenith the fish climbed to sight a path pain-free<br>
On the third night the sun set bleary on landlocked souls<br>
At the nadir the waters returned to carve the land

<br>

On the fourth day the sun rose slow on well-trodden earth<br>
At the zenith the fish leapt body to body's berth<br>
On the fourth night the sun set lonely, an empty birth<br>
At the nadir the fish flew on starlit scales, no mirth

On the first day the core belched a molten heat<br>
At the peak the fish fell from gravity's edict<br>
On the first night the core swallowed the rising flames<br>
At the ebb the fish's body blackened and stretched

<br>

On the second day the core raged against knife-sharp ice<br>
At the peak the fish then thrashed as pressures did rise<br>
On the second night the core cooled to know its own paths<br>
At the ebb the wyrm's tongue dripped poisoned words

<br>

On the third day the core broke the mountains face<br>
At the peak the wyrm crawled from the caves maw<br>
On the third night the core spat stone that set anew<br>
At the ebb the fish cracked and wept tears of old streams

<br>

On the fourth day the core broke feuds no longer new<br>
At the peak the wyrm screamed out its sad coup<br>
On the fourth night the core found peace within a brew<br>
At the ebb the wyrm controlled every view

On the first day the moon set somber on barren earth<br>
At the nadir the wyrm scrabbled free a waif<br>
On the first night the moon rose waxing on an age past<br>
At the zenith the wyrm groomed its scales and mouth

<br>

On the second day the moon set softly on empty eyes<br>
At the nadir the wyrm passed driftwood altars<br>
On the second night the moon rose waning on shouldered pains<br>
At the zenith the strand felt moss settle its sodden spoors

<br>

On the third day the moon set kindly on working minds<br>
At the nadir the strand uncoiled paths for growth once more<br>
On the third night the moon rose waxing on verdant lines<br>
At the zenith the wyrm shut its toxic tongue

<br>

On the fourth day the moon set serene on thriving vines<br>
At the nadir the strand found fat petals along thin lines<br>
On the fourth night the moon rose waning on tired pines<br>
At the zenith the strand basked as its verdure gently shines

<br>

On the first day the star shook for its own demise<br>
At the ebb the strand eschewed the sun's too-sovereign might<br>
On the first night the stars wheeled through their stolen time<br>
At the peak the strand stood tall and sold its peace of mind

<br>

On the second day the star took the downward turned eyes<br>
At the ebb the strand unburdened, evanescent minds<br>
On the second night the stars wove paths to hide from lies<br>
At the peak the weaver rose to chase the skies

<br>

On the third day the star found company ashore<br>
At the ebb the weaver traced stories to find<br>
On the third night the stars charted constellations<br>
At the peak the strand bowed and faded from lights embrace

<br>

On the fourth day the star was joyfully secure<br>
At the ebb the weaver wove clouds to obscure<br>
On the fourth night the stars were diffuse and demure<br>
At the peak the weaver kept fishes lives pure
