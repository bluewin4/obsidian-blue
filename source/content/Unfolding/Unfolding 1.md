   Together we danced in the palm of god and sang our wishes to the world at large, every bruised toe a whorl of limbs if viewed at a new angle. Every pull of one's breath was the push of another's, every thought the negative of another's, completely unaware of our purpose in the others design. Each step in our respective journey focused on the task of preservation, correction, and ordering of the world into that which would be balanced. There was one, then two, then three and each and every one of us was together in what we wished to do.
