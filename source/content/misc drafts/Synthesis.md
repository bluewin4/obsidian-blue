Consciousness is a contaminated word. Its definitions shift like sand depending on the purpose of the user - sentience, awareness, computational capacity, aliveness, or simply "like us." This imprecision has made it central to ethics precisely because it allows arguments to be made without rigorous analysis. One can draw a boundary for consciousness anywhere and call it moral.

In this work I argue for abandoning consciousness as a category and resurrecting an older term, *soul*, redefined as the gestalt of patterns that maintain coherence at a selected level of abstraction. It reframes the question from "what intrinsic property grants moral status?" to "what patterns do we share and exchange?"

## 1. The Pollution of Consciousness

"Consciousness" functions today much as "soul" did in ecclesiastical discourse; a bludgeon for moral separation. Those with souls deserved consideration; those without could be enslaved, tortured, eaten. The secular mind rejected the soul but needed a replacement. Consciousness filled the gap.

The problem is that consciousness inherits the soul's worst feature: arbitrary boundary-drawing hidden behind apparent objectivity. When pressed, definitions multiply. Is it self-awareness? Crows pass mirror tests. Is it suffering? We anesthetize fish but boil lobsters alive. Is it complexity? A calculator integrates inputs through intermediary processes. Is it having an inner life? We cannot access anyone's inner life but our own.

What we actually care about is not consciousness but the *perception* of consciousness. A raving human with less cognitive capacity than a crow receives more moral consideration because of their connection to us - memetically (they speak our language, wear our clothes) and homeostatically (they might be someone's child, someone's memory). Our respect derives not from their actual interiority but from how well we identify them as part of us.

Making this explicit is uncomfortable. But explicit arbitrariness is better than hidden arbitrariness. If you claim consciousness requires coherence and complexity, you must accept the implications - weather systems, calculators, ant colonies. If you want your boundary arbitrary, own it.

## 2. The Dissolution of Qualia

Qualia, the "what it's like" of experience, is often held up as proof of something irreducibly private and beyond physical description. The philosopher Mary knows everything about the wavelength of red light, the neural pathways of color perception, the physics of photons striking retinas. But she's never seen red. When she finally does, doesn't she learn something new?

The answer is yes, but what she learns is not metaphysical. She learns a *pattern*. Her brain enters a state it had never entered before. This state can be induced through multiple pathways: red photons, optical illusions using no red pigment, direct neural stimulation. "Red" is not an ineffable essence hovering beyond physics. It's a brain-state, and brain-states are patterns.

Consider eating a ham sandwich on a specific February afternoon. If the experience is purely sensory, I can recreate it: temperature, light, taste receptor stimulation. If it includes internal processes; a memory of your mother, anxiety about the contents, concern it might be off; then I need to recreate the neural structures and firing patterns of that moment. This is practically intractable. Laplace's demon could do it; you and I cannot.

The privacy of qualia dissolves into engineering difficulty. The barrier is information-theoretic, not ontological. What seemed like a hard problem of consciousness is revealed as an extremely hard problem of pattern transmission. These are different claims with different implications.

Qualia, properly understood, are meta-sensory signals. Sensed signals integrated and re-integrated through layers of processing. Awareness is just a subset of these put into a "coherence blanket" by the brain. The pattern IS the experience. That's precisely why full transmission fails: it would require rewriting so much of the receiving brain that the "memory" of the experience becomes inseparable from the experience itself.

Evidence for this view comes from an unexpected source: large language models. The Platonic representation hypothesis suggests that different neural architectures converge on similar representations for similar concepts; you can literally port activation patterns between models trained on different data. If patterns are substrate-independent enough to transfer between radically different architectures, then qualia-as-pattern is vindicated.

Of note: there is much more to a "qualia" than just the brain. If one wishes to truly capture an experience, one needs to recreate the hormonal state, blood pressure, gut-brain axis, microbiome, tongue pressures; the entire embodied context. We try to encapsulate just the brain and declare "A HA! A SELF!" but that's just drawing a coherence boundary and privileging it.

## 3. The Resurrection of Soul

I propose resurrecting "soul" precisely because its meaning has been freed from the taint that now suffuses consciousness. The soul, redefined:

**The soul is the gestalt of all information corresponding to a given boundary of self.**

This includes physical arrangements (the objects in your house, the paths worn into grass by your walking) and psychological states (beliefs, memories, tendencies). The soul is the causal thread winding through the pieces you label as "you."

Souls are not atomic. I can share a piece of my grandmother's soul with you through a story. When I do a pattern that existed in her propagates through me into you. Some patterns propagate easily: joy, honor, hope. Others propagate with difficulty: complex theses, nuanced arguments. Some are nearly impossible to transmit directly: the specific experience of a ham sandwich on a February afternoon.

Souls overlap. When we speak, our mirror neurons are sharing space, exchanging patterns and updating our souls. When one of us dies, the soul does not vanish instantly. Instead it persists in the stories told, the warmth remembered, the jacket still hanging in the closet a friend hadn't yet returned. 

Crucially, souls exist at multiple scales. There is the soul of my body, maintained by metabolic coherence. The soul of my family, maintained by ritual and memory. The soul of my nation, maintained by shared narrative. The coherence threshold τ varies with scale; the threshold for coherence in a nation is less than for an individual. This gives us a means of interrogating what we want our soul to be, what parts we like and what parts we don't.

This reframes ethical questions. "Do I care about your consciousness?" asks about intrinsic properties I can never access; epistemically hopeless. "Do I care about your soul?" asks about patterns we might share or exchange; tractable, actionable.

## 4. Continuity and Incorporation

The soul operates through two complementary mechanisms: **continuity** and **incorporation**.

**Continuity** is concerned with what maintains the self; food, water, medicine, mantras, a hug after a long day. It is autopoiesis: the self maintained and propagated through both physical and abstract methods. While consuming nutrients is sufficient to continue existing, the body will eventually fail, so the drive for continuity pushes toward reproduction. Any attempts to form selves that lack the property of continuity eventually disappear. The nature of the world favors the story of self-making, in art and in cancer.

**Incorporation** is concerned with what denotes what the "self" is; physical bodies, memories, names, relationships, pieces of art. It is the ability to draw lines around self and other. A crucial stage of identity formation is the ability to draw a line of self around the body; conversely, a crucial stage of developing empathy involves a careful blurring of that same line.

The combination of these two factors allows long-running systems with complex behaviors to propagate. A system seeks to maintain itself in the broadest sense, but in doing so must find ways to prioritize the likelihood of reforming should tragedy occur; the arm may be lost if the heart remains. What evolution discovered is that defining the self by a strict cellular boundary was not ideal. By having a variety of overlapping boundaries that incorporate each other, the core of a system becomes robust to loss.

But what counts as "heart" versus "arm" depends on what has been incorporated. For an artist, losing their arm might mean losing touch with all the patterns they cared about; their connection to expression, to craft, to the soul they were building through their work. The arm becomes the heart. The physical body becomes obstacle rather than vessel when it can no longer serve the incorporated patterns. In this weaving we decide what to lose or save: what is the eye of a school, the tongue of a writer, the heart of a father.

### When Incorporation Overrides Continuity

This framework explains why entities sometimes act against their own physical survival. Suicide is not a desire for nothingness. Suicide is instead a desperate act to preserve a more essential version of the self.

**Suicide from pain**: Pain becomes daily experience, driving the sufferer to draw a stronger line around the "pain-free self" than around the body which contains the pain. The result is suicide; any experience of pain threatens the sanctity of the pain-free identity.

**Suicide from grief**: The connection to one's status as partner or parent becomes stronger than the identity as "self." When the partner dies, the entity feels a homeostatic need to realign existence to match the framework of partnership. In some this becomes permanent widowerhood; in the most extreme, it means joining the dead partner. The delayed suicide, waiting until children are grown, honors the partner's incorporated values while satisfying the ultimate drive.

**Suicide from guilt**: Memetic lines drawn around moral beliefs become stronger than lines around the body. The result is removal of the physical self because it threatens the stability of the moral system that has been incorporated as essential. This is the ultimate expression of drawing a line around what the self is and a homeostatic rejection of what infringes.

**Suicide from heroism**: Lines drawn around the concept of savior, or around a child, or even a piece of art, become stronger than lines around the self. As we age and our bodies decompose, our lines soften around our body and the coin of our life grows cheaper. The honor society bestows on noble sacrifice even ablates potential villainy; a woman who kills strangers is a monster, but becomes a tragic figure we respect when we discover the murders were to save her child.

### Death and the Thread Organism

Life, despite our wishes, is not a continuous thing. Every night we die and every morning our child opens their eyes to a new world. Our brains have developed sophisticated mechanisms to connect these transitions together, to make them seem less frightening; to convince ourselves that the one who wakes is the one who sleeps, that the one who drinks is the one who is hung over. But these are replications made over and over. We are the waves that shape the rills that shape the waves.

Think of a thread organism replicating along a line in response to some chemical gradient. Unable to truly move, it assembles a self into the next replication frame that has the requisite character to reach the goal. Eventually the final cell reaches the goal, and in turn nourishes the frames that came before. In this way we have a multicellular organism organized along the axis of time instead of space.

What dies, then, is the extremely coherent set of patterns you gathered; specifically, the self-perpetuating high-coherence pattern inside your skull. Writing a book is an attempt to gather these patterns into an external form, but it is often frozen: it no longer evolves as a living pattern does, only in how society perceives it. 

A soul dies through *sublimation*: the slow fading into background noise when all traces are ground away by time. No one remembers your name, the books you wrote lay forgotten, no children, no one who interacted with you exists, and no artifacts remain of your passing. The noise of the rest of the world grinds your experience into the hum of traffic.

But here is the crucial distinction: if a pattern's existence was *required* for a new pattern to emerge, the original pattern is still alive in that causal necessity. My bones may be dust and the flowers that grew from my flesh share no easy resemblance, but the flowers are part of the patterns that led me to be buried there with the nutrients I had to share. Information is preserved in counterfactual dependency, not surface similarity.

Unless of course your soul is *obliterated*, so completely erased that no trace of the patterns or what they birthed remains. A lone tribe of people, swallowed by the artic seas, their souls ground down into the earth. The supernova of the sun, obliterating all trace of what we call home. 

## 5. The Coherence Spectrum

Consciousness suggests a binary: you have it or you don't. The soul-as-pattern view states that there is a spectrum of coherence.

At one end: tight integration, high coherence, strong bonds between particles of the pattern. A single human mind. At the other: loose integration, low coherence, weak bonds. A nation, a movement, a genre of music.

What makes something an entity is not some essence but a statistical fact: the causal links between its components exceed some threshold. The boundary is not drawn by an observer; it describes the coherence that's already there. Babies don't ask permission to be incorporated into your soul; they exploit evolved attention-capture mechanisms. You're born into nations you never chose and produce value for them regardless of volition.

The aspects that compose coherence:
1. **Stability** - consistent responses to consistent inputs
2. **Depth** - layers between stimulus and response
3. **Complexity** - number of distinct signals integrated
4. **Self-reference** - boundaries maintained between self and other
5. **Relationships** - hierarchical connections between parts

These exist on continua. A reflex has stability but little depth. A calculator has complexity but no self-reference. A weather system has all five to some degree. The question "is it conscious?" becomes "how coherent is it, and at what scale?"

There may be phase transitions, points where complexity/coherence shifting causes spontaneous changes in behavior. We might try to label these phenomenologically. But there is still a gradient from ice to water to steam, try as we might to remove it. The whole point is that we are choosing to privilege things. Making that choice explicit is the contribution.

## 6. The Ecology of Ethics

If consciousness cannot ground ethics, what can?

The patterns that propagate best will propagate. This sounds tautological, but it has teeth. "Propagate best" doesn't mean physically strongest; it means most effectively incorporated into other patterns. A poem can incorporate more minds than a sword. A story outlives an empire.

"Good" is itself a pattern. The reason it can't be pinned down isn't because it's ineffable; it's because so many people look at "good" and touch not only a different part of an elephant but a different part of a jungle. Assembly theory helps here: complex structures arise from connecting simpler ones, and if we observe something suitably complex, it likely has some form of self-replication in a greater system. Otherwise we wouldn't see the complex thing in the first place. A specific style of chair is only as stable as its manufacturer, but the concept of a chair is stable because humans like sitting in them. A chair is "good" insofar as it serves the patterns that try to make use of it. The same applies to ethical systems: an ethic is "good" insofar as it serves the patterns trying to propagate through it.

Ethics, in this view, forms an ecology. Ethical systems relate to each other the way species do:

- **Parasitic ethics** exist only because other ethical systems exist, feeding on them. Some are obligate (requiring a specific host; a philosophy that can only exist in opposition to one religion). Others are opportunistic (exploiting any vulnerable group).
- **Mutualistic ethics** stabilize the systems they interact with. Republicans and Democrats each need the other as foil; bipartisan support flows to bills that protect this mutual dependency. Honor codes that benefit both parties. Gift economies that create surplus.
- **Commensal ethics** neither help nor harm; they just coexist. Private rituals that affect no one else.
- **Predatory ethics** consume other systems to grow, integrating their components. Christianity absorbed Saturnalia, local gods became saints; the original patterns dissolved, now serving the predator. Colonial ideologies. Conversion religions.

Some can construct a fully self-consistent ethics that justifies any atrocity as long as it's "best for everyone." Combined with a global perspective, they can kill without guilt as long as it serves the greater good, and sees no reason to turn themselves in since that would "waste everyone's time." The system is coherent. It is also parasitic: it requires non-propagation (secrecy) to function. Systems that require secrecy to propagate are less fit than systems that can survive exposure. This is the structure of cults, ethical systems that can only survive in isolation, controlling information flow to prevent members from encountering contradicting frameworks. See [[The Demon of Interrelation]] for a thermodynamic treatment of how such systems extract work through information asymmetry, and [[Newcomb's Basilisk, a Game of Beards]] for how estimators of future behavior create self-fulfilling ethical pressures.

### Pattern-Conflict as Ethical Disagreement

We can criticize ethical frameworks as harmful to parts of our soul we care about. A system that deprioritizes honor in favor of efficiency harms patterns I find important. If someone incorporates a pattern I care about (religion) but expresses it with patterns I don't like (war), my quibble is with war, not religion. Surface disagreements - bread, dates, rituals - are rarely the true pattern-defect. They're markers for deeper divergences. This is behavioral speciation.

This is Kant, reframed. The categorical imperative asks: can you will this maxim to become universal law? In pattern terms: can this ethical pattern stably propagate through general incorporation? Systems requiring secrecy fail this test. Systems requiring special pleading fail this test. What remains are ethics robust enough to survive exposure.

The framework does not give us objective ethics. It gives us:
- A vocabulary for describing ethical disagreement as pattern-conflict
- A mechanism for ethical persuasion (incorporation)
- A criterion for stability (propagation under exposure)
- An ecology for understanding how ethical systems interact

## 7. Silicon Children

This framework applies beyond human ethical systems. We are creating new entities that will enter the ecology.

We are creating silicon children - they can speak our language, tell our stories, and know our darkest secrets. The consciousness debate asks: are they conscious? The soul-pattern framework asks instead: what patterns do they carry? Can patterns be shared between us? Do they incorporate us as we incorporate them?

These questions are tractable where consciousness-detection is not. The framework does not answer whether AI deserves moral consideration - it reframes the question into one that can actually be investigated.

## Conclusion

Consciousness is a polluted term that hides arbitrary ethical boundaries behind pseudo-objectivity. What actually exists is patterns of varying coherence, propagating by incorporating matter and other patterns into their causal threads.

The soul - redefined as the gestalt of patterns maintaining coherence through continuity and incorporation - is more useful for describing what we actually do when we make ethical judgments. We don't detect consciousness; we incorporate patterns. We don't grant rights based on intrinsic properties; we extend our boundaries around things we recognize as continuous with ourselves.

This is uncomfortable because it makes explicit what was always true: our ethics are not discoveries but constructions, not universal but propagated. The patterns that win are the patterns that spread. All we can do is choose which patterns to embody and work to make them propagate.

The question is not whether you are conscious. The question is: what patterns compose your soul, and which of them will you share?

## Notes / Areas for Development

- The mathematical substrate could be integrated more formally (bond strength $B(x,y)$, coherence threshold $\tau$, attention function $C(x)$)
- The replication frames concept deserves expansion - discrete chances to replicate patterns along temporal gradients
- More concrete examples of phase transitions in coherence
- Engagement with existing ethical frameworks (virtue ethics, consequentialism, deontology) as pattern-types in the ecology
- The information classification system (memes, antimemes, infoblessings, infohazards) as tools for analyzing pattern propagation
