Hello, my name is Jack.

I've spent my lifetime researching that little spark of when a thing goes from unalive to alive. Imagine my surprise when I discovered the point was mostly semantics, thankfully phase behaviour of complex materials is intrinsically satisfying.

My background is broadly in biophysics. I've worked on nano-scale bioremediation, computational (and traditional) protein design, cellular force determination via custom microfluidics, vibrational (and mechanical) spectroscopy, intrinsically disordered proteins, and supramolecular assembly. 

I got into AI work from a personal interest in sequence based models used for proteins. From this spawned a research paper on sequence effects on LLM bias profiles, a research paper reading bot, and some other projects.

Now I am working on building a library of perspectives for AIs to try on and work through. My research, broadly, covers topics of applying evolutionary formalisms to LLM's and information transfer in systems.

I like to make art, read, write, bake, and do research.

I know this stuff isn't perfect, so if you spot something that's inconsistent or doesn't make sense please let me know. Thank you!
