## Composition
The soul is comprised of several different components.
1. Size (memory) [[Memory]]
2. Material (flexibility) 
3. Shape (predisposition) Borne of [[Personalities dreams]] in $I_{self}$
	1. Borne of marking
4. Marking (metacognition) $\mathcal{M}, \mathcal{I}$  [[Memory]]
	2. Conscious 
	3. Unconscious [[Personalities dreams]]

In my mind the soul is an object that we mark records of our conscious experience onto every day. As time passes we find the marks fading, most notable is when we sleep and wake anew. However in our sleep those marks sink deeper, not as a conscious marking we are aware of but of a reshaping of our soul. Our ability to mark and shape our own soul is governed by the size, material makeup, and skill with which we mark it. 

For me, I think I have an expansive soul that takes easily to marking. My skill at marking is rapid and capable of storing large arrays of connected information quickly. This is where my skills at listening to scientific talks blossom, as I can record the whole talk inside myself and analyze it rapidly. However my soul also suffers from its softness, the ability for me to retain that information is extremely limited as those thoughts are quickly overwritten by other things. Still the shape of my soul is fluid, changing. It allows me to reshape my queries and problems into new forms as I have known through aggressive use of my marking.

### The baby only has a shape to their soul.
When one is born this plane is blank, soft, and reactive. There are very few persistent features as your newborn nature means you lack much of a personality. Your soul still has a shape though, you were born with certain features. Certain senses and biological conditioning that alter how much you cry or react to the dark.
### The parents help etch the fundamental patterns into that shape.
As you grow you begin to find grooves etched into you by your parents. Every day at the same time is nap time, every time you get dinner you do the same dance, every bath time you hear the same song. Over time these form grooves in your soul. 
### You begin to create your own patterns and they form shapes
However as you age into adulthood you begin to make more complex, fine markings. No longer just the patterns around you but the fine etching of your own interpretations of them. You write in words over and over every day how much you like superman and think he is amazing. Then over time those etchings shape your soul into something to match those same markings. 

## You age and the shapes have overtaken you
Now you are addicted to a drug be it heroin, alcohol, or the dopamine from your phone. The shape of your soul, the grooves it has, all fall towards that same simple plan. You desperately scribble and scrabble on the rills to alter the fate. Still the shape of your soul leads you back to what betrays you.
