The way you can tell you are there is by a hollowness inside of your stomach and chest, one that is only filled with a sense of impending doom. 

No matter how nice the environment the feeling will remain.

I am only realizing today the connection between this paracosm and a gift I was given at the end of a long dream. The gift was a way to bring myself back into the world of dreams, I thought, but I think it may be a key to returning to this paracosm. I received it as a gift for solving some great problem in my paracosm.

Lay your head on your pillow with your ear to it.
Listen deeply through it, until your senses are about 10 paces deep.
Listen for the bubblegum pink, yet very clear, stream tumbling over smoothed blue and grey river stones.
The sound should be that of a chorus of stones, each trickle of water not a burble but a voice in the choir.
The world around is a stark white save the river.
You find yourself on the side of the river when you listen long enough, you can stand up and walk into your dreams. 
I saw a strand of trees, ash and birch. I would then fall into my sleep from there.

But I think I can see the way again. I wonder what I will see, the beach of wandering waves, the Pools of Sea White Chalk, the Square Garden, the Forest of the Elder Things, the Time Twisted Hospital, the Purple-Grey Wheat fields with the small house in the middle, the Endless Market, the Labryinth City, the Sunny Oak Villa, the Lattice Works, the Winding Mountains with their many vaults, the Towns Owned by the Rabbit Creatures, the Theater of the Mind and it's many films, the Steep Sidewalks that lead there, or the City on the Sea Wall where I held back the wave that chased me for years?
