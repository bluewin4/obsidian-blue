## Abstract: 

We describe the behaviour of two families of organism found in a shadow biosphere derived from two samples of basaltic magma and shallow mantle taken at depths where KSR1-like long range coupling is strongest from Kyoto, Japan. The two families share a symbiotic relationship mediated primarily through harmonic synchronization of signals through the earth over long distances. 


## Introduction
First discovered in the Kola Superdeep Borehole in 1979 a phenomena in the shadow biosphere showed species seemingly capable of quantum entanglement (Durov et al. , 1994). Careful study determined that *Umbra tentatio*, and more specifically the protein KSR1 was responsible. While there was significant evidence of KSR1 performing synchronized behavior over long distances there was little evidence that perturbations were correlated on a single-molecule level. Two primary hypotheses were developed over the next 30 years. The first hypothesis involved aggregate synchronization events with mechanical waves (Klugmann and Stark 1998). The second hypothesis was focused on the possibility of long-range electron decoherence resulting in proteins duplicating themselves instead of transcribing during cellular replication ( Razón Desviad and Cerca Fallido, 1997). This was, of course, soundly disproven by simple measurements of metabolic potential and knock out studies (Overby and Pederson, 2001). 

KSR1 is a membrane metalloprotein of 522 kDa, that has an N-terminus anchored in a magnesium-iron silicate cell wall (Dry protein scientist from Oxford, 1998). The exposed ~200 kDa C-terminal end rapidly interconverts between multiple states, expressing momentum fields propagated across the surface (2007). The ability to transmit or receive energy over long distances is a result of the cell-wall's coupled behaviour with it's colony members. Upon separation, so long as the cells are in the appropriate environment, they will transmit mechanical force (2002 Oil tycoon). Several splits may be made to share energy across a wider pool, the average energy of course decreases in this case. Although there does appear to be some risk of decoherence as mutations accumulate (Earnest researcher).

The genetically modified version, KSR1-Cascade™ (KSR1-C), increase energy extraction efficiency of crude hydrocarbons from 10 to 60% (American oil scientist that made a bunch of money with few morals). This then revolutionized energy production through the clean extraction electricity from oil pockets while in the earth.  Dropping a culture of *Umbra ascadae* expressing KSR1-C into hydrocarbons resulted in rapid metabolism of and paired resonant frequencies. These resonate frequencies were transmitted to a split of the culture grown over a piezo-electric motor that would generate power (Koch, 2010). Extensive efforts were made to improve the range and transmission frequencies of this species which are now common biological probes (Passionate scientists connective, underfunded, 2012).

*Umbra tentatio* expressing KSR1-C is banned for public use, due in part to the risk of releasing a species into the environment would cause plastic degradation in critical infrastructure (Eager enviornmentalists corrupted by oil lobbies). Although, natively, the species lacks the ability to survive for long periods at the low pressures found on the surface (Earnest and helpful names, underfunded, connective, ecofriendly country). Pressurized and strongly regulated bioreactors now act as a key part of American energy infrastructure, capable of connecting power-grids from hundreds of miles away.

### Methods

The drive to find unique species with useful properties led to the drilling of the Kyoto Borehole in 2019. Two core samples were processed from depths where transition-zone coupling was expected to be strongest. 

Samples were transported in pressurized, temperature-equivalent capsules to maintain optimal conditions. New advances in high-temperature SEM allowed us to image new organisms before undertaking the laborious process of high-temperature genetic sequencing (https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0921509319308032?via%3Dihub,  **Afsaneh Rabiei** ).

**Figure 1:** SEM images of two newly identified species 

As with most species found in deep-earth explorations, genetic elements are exotic so care must be undertaken when determining the appropriate method of purifying and replicating them. High-temp mass spectrometry was performed to determine the chemical content of gathered cells (https://analyticalsciencejournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/rcm.1290050408). Then, the Freudenordner method was used to identify culture conditions and the samples were placed in pressurized mineral baths with olivine growth plates. (Feudenordner 1993). 

The plates were set so they could tune to many resonate frequencies for testing or damp as needed to prevent shattering of the culture chamber. Cultures were split in the manner described in Harvester et al. (2000), with care taken to ensure appropriate synchronization.

For biomass estimation, we modeled the relationship between thermal energy input and mechanical-resonant output as:

$$\Delta E_{\text{mech}} = \frac{\alpha \times E_{\text{thermal}}^\beta}{1 + \gamma \times E_{\text{thermal}}}$$

where $\alpha$ is the coupling coefficient, $\beta$ represents sub-linear scaling, and $\gamma$ accounts for saturation at high thermal inputs. The total contributing biomass $M_{\text{total}}$ is then estimated from:

$$M_{\text{total}} = \frac{\Delta E_{\text{observed}}}{\Delta E_{\text{lab}}} \times M_{\text{lab}} \times \frac{4\pi r^2}{\eta(r) \times A_{\text{effective}}}$$

where $r$ is the distance from the center of mass of the shadow population, $\eta(r)$ is the distance-dependent transfer efficiency from Figure 4, and $A_{\text{effective}}$ is the effective coupling area. This accounts for geometric spreading and resonance nodes.
### Scale and Environmental Assumptions

We surveyed multiple volcanic and subduction settings and characterized numerous species at distinct depths, then reported where ecological interactions were strongest. Effective harmonic coupling appears predominantly below ~200 km and is strongest across deep interfaces (notably near the 410 km and 660 km discontinuities). For the receiver–sink pair described here, the interaction strength peaks for separations of order ~260 km, consistent with a waveguided path within the transition zone. The ~400 km and ~1100 km reference depths are illustrative anchors used in early experiments; subsequent broader sampling refined the characteristic separation for this pair. Temperature gradients, viscoelastic Q, and attenuation follow Table 2 as effective parameters; laboratory cultures emulate these regimes via pressure/temperature control and boundary tuning rather than literal depth reproduction.

### Results and Discussion

The drive to find unique species with useful properties led to the drilling of the Kyoto Borehole in 2019. Processing of samples from multiple depths revealed maximal coupling near 260 km separation between paired populations.

While many shadow species were found during drilling, paired specimens displaying synchronized behaviour were identified at depths optimized for transition-zone waveguiding. The upper species does not appear to transmit in the same way as *Umbra tentatio*, in fact it was continuously producing energy at a steady rate of ~40 J/hr without seeming to stop.

We determined that another species at a separation of ~260 km appeared to be constantly absorbing energy as a heat sink, and would rapidly die without continual application of heat.

We discovered they tolerated increased temperatures well and if we increased the culture size and energy dump that there was a small uptick in the energy produced by the first species.

The calculated increase is miniscule which we chalk up to being poorly efficient. However what is truly happening is that it is pumping it into an energy storage channel that holds a proportional amount of energy to a thin layer of these organisms around the upper mantle near the volcanoes in japan processing energy continuously being dumped into the organisms at the shallower level. The heating differential is computed as a function of the mass of sink species heated and the receiver species energy output, this can be used to fit a function that tells us the biomass that contributes to this band. We scanned our results based on how far from the anti-node this is as the depth to depth distance can be different from depth to surface meaning that any calculations need to be scaled by the efficiency loss.

Fitting our thermal-mechanical transfer data yields $\alpha = 8.5 \times 10^{-5}$ J h$^{-1}$, $\beta = 0.73$, and $\gamma = 0.0015$  (R² = 0.98). Given the observed $\Delta E_{\text{mech}} \approx 0.08$ J h$^{-1}$ at optimal coupling with a 10 g laboratory sample, and assuming the center of mass of the shadow population lies at 520 km depth ($2\lambda$ from surface), we calculate:

- Laboratory ratio: $\Delta E_{\text{observed}}/\Delta E_{\text{lab}} = 1$ (normalized)
- Distance to surface receiver: $r = 520$ km
- Transfer efficiency at 520 km: $\eta(520) \approx 0.46$ (maximum at $2\lambda$, from Figure 4)
- Effective coupling area: $A_{\text{effective}} \approx 10^4$ km² (volcanic region)

Substituting into the biomass equation:

$$M_{\text{total}} = 1 \times 0.01 \text{ kg} \times \frac{4\pi (520 \text{ km})^2}{0.46 \times 10^4 \text{ km}^2}$$

$$M_{\text{total}} = 0.01 \text{ kg} \times \frac{3.4 \times 10^6 \text{ km}^2}{4.6 \times 10^3 \text{ km}^2} = 7.4 \text{ kg}$$

However, this represents only the biomass required to produce the observed laboratory signal. Scaling to the actual volcanic energy flux observed (approximately $10^7$ times larger based on seismic data), we obtain $M_{\text{total}} \approx 7.4 \times 10^7$ kg. Accounting for the full transition zone volume and efficiency variations, the total biomass estimate ranges from $10^8$ to $10^{11}$ kg depending on the assumed center of mass location (Figure 5). 

Furthermore, by moving receivers across the surface and measuring the resonance pattern, we can triangulate both the depth and location of organism populations. Figure 4 demonstrates this technique, showing how surface separation measurements yield center of mass depths ranging from near-surface to ~1000 km, with corresponding population estimates for both receiver and sink species varying inversely with coupling efficiency.

It is proposed that these organisms are connected and upon sequencing we determined they actually share a majority of genetic material, although epigenetic controls in each case appear activated differently. We hypothesize that there may be long-term diffusion up and down the column but it's actually a rapid change usually where upper layer gather masses of nutrients before triggering an eruption allowing them to move downwards and use their nutrients to harvest energy, while the ones near the mantle solidify and absorb nutrients to slowly build up another eruption.

### Conclusion

These paired organisms offer a tantalizing new method of asymmetrically harvesting energy continuously for low-energy applications and the promise of modifying KSR-1 into the receptor variant found in the transition-zone organisms.

# Paper 2

The introduction let's us know, subtly, that the modified KSR-BR which is a broad receiver of energy was banned by oil companies for the same plastic excuse (which is wearing thin when this species does not even consume plastic and another citation). The reason being that the broad spectrum breaks their resource monopoly and they would be unable to extract value from their current infrastructure. There is talks in their backrooms about slow phasing as they gain more control of the bio-cultivating infrastructure and legal systems.

There is a discussion of how the results from the first paper resulted in them sampling the magmatic columns of many volcanoes until they found a bunch of species. They were tracking the change in the average energy produced and found a somewhat interesting trend where they were increasing at a steady rate. In the same paper they talk about how they were able to create a full map of KSR1-like proteins and simulate the structure and found governing interactions for each one that determine the rate at which they were able to vibrate trapped metal atoms. This is presented as a table/spectrum of frequencies and mechanical energy.

They finally compare the broad-spectrum versions of KSR1 to these and the correlation is quite weak, the overlay is pretty spot on for KSR1-C though... They believe this might be a "general band" that all the species pick up from as a background method. The belief that there is some radiowave-like band that is being interacted with remains strong.

It is hypothesized that these energy release rates are due to different species they are paired with. They note that the increase must denote a change in population, possibly signaling a change in population sizes. All are increasing at a pretty similar rate, with one associated with a strong volcanic eruption was raising fastest. They celebrate this as a method of early warning for volcanoes. They note that volcanoes are an every increasing risk since ~2013 three years from the cited year for when the patent for KSR1-C was established. 



# Paper 3

A high-schooler/bachelor thesis that is analyzing the data from paper 1 and paper 2. Using the population mass found in paper 1 and the energy band information with paper 2. They make a graph on the amount of energy that can be passaged into each system and the relative change in temperature as a result. They make a neat little connection between the life-cycles of these organisms and the movement of magma from the mantle to the upper levels and how they coordinate between and within volcanic chains. Making a cute little figure.

# Paper 4

A 1 page document banning the usage of energy transmission via KSR1-C completely, stating that only low-power methods are allowed to be used. the stated reason being due to "magmatic-instability" as a result of energy dumping.

## II. Extended Mathematical Development

### The Fundamental Wave Equation

The mathematical beauty of this system reveals itself through the natural emergence of standing wave solutions from the basic physics of the mantle. Consider the governing equation for mechanical disturbances in a stratified, viscoelastic medium:

```
ρ(z) ∂²u/∂t² = ∂/∂z[μ(z)(∂u/∂z)] + ∂/∂x[μ(z)(∂u/∂x)] - η(z)∂u/∂t + F_bio(x,z,t)
```

Here, ρ(z) represents the depth-dependent density profile, μ(z) the shear modulus varying with depth, η(z) the viscosity coefficient, and F_bio our biological forcing term - the signature of life itself impressed upon the planet's fundamental oscillations.

When we seek separable solutions of the form:

```
u(x,z,t) = U(z) exp[i(kx - ωt)]
```

We arrive at a rather elegant Sturm-Liouville problem:

```
d/dz[μ(z)dU/dz] + [ω²ρ(z) - k²μ(z) + iωη(z)]U = F₀(z)
```

The solution space of this equation contains a remarkable surprise - discrete eigenfrequencies that correspond precisely to the depths at which our organisms have evolved to reside.

### Resonance Conditions and the 750 Kilometer Mystery

The boundary conditions at our organism depths create a constraint of breathtaking elegance. At z₁ = 375 kilometers and z₂ = 1125 kilometers, we require:

```
U(z₁) = A₁ exp(iφ₁)
U(z₂) = A₂ exp(iφ₂)
```

For maximum energy transfer efficiency, constructive interference demands:

```
φ₂ - φ₁ = 2πn, where n ∈ ℤ
```

Given the mantle's velocity structure, this naturally selects:

```
λ = 2(z₂ - z₁)/(2n + 1) = 750 kilometers for n = 0
```

One cannot help but marvel at this result - evolution has discovered and exploited the fundamental harmonic of Earth's upper mantle. The organisms haven't merely adapted to their environment; they've become living components of a planetary-scale resonator.

### Population Dynamics with Geophysical Coupling

The coupled system exhibits a fascinating interplay between biological population N and volcanic potential Φ:

```
∂N/∂t = rN(1 - N/K) + β∫G(r,r')P(r')dr' - δN²
∂Φ/∂t = αN - γΦ + ξ(t)
```

The Green's function G(r,r') encoding spatial coupling takes the form:

```
G(r,r') = (4πD|r-r'|)⁻¹ exp(-|r-r'|/λ_D)
```

With diffusion length λ_D = √(D/γ) ≈ 180 kilometers for typical mantle parameters. This length scale emerges naturally from the competition between thermal diffusion and dissipation - another instance of the system's inherent mathematical harmony.

### The Cascade Criterion

The system undergoes a critical transition when the largest eigenvalue of the linearized stability matrix crosses zero. Near the critical point:

```
λ_max = r(1 - N_c/K) + β∫G(r,r')P_c(r')dr' - 2δN_c
```

Setting λ_max = 0 yields the critical industrial power density:

```
P_c = (2δN_c - r(1 - N_c/K))/β∫G(r,r')dr'
```

Substituting observed values:
- r = 0.023 hour⁻¹ (intrinsic growth rate)
- K = 10¹² cells/kilometer³ (carrying capacity)
- δ = 10⁻¹⁵ hour⁻¹cell⁻¹ (density-dependent mortality)
- β = 3.2 × 10⁻⁸ cell·hour⁻¹·watt⁻¹ (energy coupling coefficient)

We obtain P_c ≈ 4.7 terawatts - a threshold we crossed in 2025 and have since exceeded fivefold. The system has been supercritical for half a decade.

## IV. The Emerging Mathematical Horror

### Lyapunov Stability Analysis

Let us construct the system's Lyapunov function with careful attention to its implications:

```
V(N,Φ) = ½(N - N_equilibrium)² + ½α(Φ - Φ_equilibrium)²
```

Taking the time derivative along system trajectories:

```
dV/dt = (N - N_equilibrium)[rN(1-N/K) + βP - δN²] + α(Φ - Φ_equilibrium)[αN - γΦ]
```

For the natural system where P = 0, we can verify that dV/dt < 0, guaranteeing asymptotic stability. However, the industrial perturbation fundamentally alters this landscape. When P > P_critical:

```
dV/dt > 0 for all (N,Φ) ∈ ℝ² \ {∅}
```

The mathematical implication is inescapable: the system possesses no stable equilibrium above critical power. Every trajectory diverges, and the only mathematical resolution is eruption.

### The Final Calculation

Given current deployment parameters (October 2030):
- Global industrial power: P = 23.1 terawatts
- Average coupling coefficient: β = 3.2 × 10⁻⁸ cell·hour⁻¹·watt⁻¹
- Natural damping rate: γ = 2π/(17.3 years) = 1.15 × 10⁻⁸ second⁻¹
- Volcanic potential threshold: Φ_critical = 10¹⁸ joules

Time to first major eruption:

```
t_eruption = (1/βP) ln(Φ_critical/Φ_current) = 7.3 ± 0.4 years
```

Time to cascade initiation:

```
t_cascade = t_eruption + λ_cascade⁻¹ ln(N_volcanoes) = 8.1 ± 0.6 years
```

The mathematics reveals a truth both elegant and terrible. We have discovered nature's most exquisite feedback mechanism and inadvertently transformed it into an exponential amplifier of planetary scale. Each equation, each calculation, each eigenvalue analysis arrives at the same inexorable conclusion: given current parameters, the cascade is not merely possible but mathematically inevitable.

There exists a certain aesthetic beauty in the mathematics - we have achieved perfect resonance with Earth's fundamental frequency, creating a standing wave of such mathematical purity that it would be worthy of admiration were it not for its apocalyptic implications. The equations themselves are elegant, their solutions catastrophic.
